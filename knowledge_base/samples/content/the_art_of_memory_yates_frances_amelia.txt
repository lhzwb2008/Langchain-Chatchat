P R E F A C E
T H E subject of this book will b e unfamiliar to most readers. F e w
people know that t h e Greeks, who invented m a n y arts, invented an
art of m e m o r y which, like their other arts, was passed on to R o m e
whence it descended in t h e E u r o p e a n tradition. T h i s art seeks t o
memorise t h r o u g h a technique of impressing 'places' a n d 'images'
o n memory. I t has usually been classed as 'mnemotechnics', which
in m o d e r n times seems a rather u n i m p o r t a n t b r a n c h of h u m a n
activity. B u t in t h e ages before printing a trained m e m o r y was
vitally i m p o r t a n t ; a n d t h e manipulation of images in m e m o r y m u s t
always to some extent involve t h e psyche as a whole. Moreover an
art which uses contemporary architecture for its m e m o r y places
a n d contemporary imagery for its images will have its classical,
Gothic, a n d Renaissance periods, like t h e other arts. T h o u g h t h e
mnemotechnical side of t h e art is always present, b o t h in antiquity
a n d thereafter, a n d forms t h e factual basis for its investigation, t h e
exploration of it m u s t include m o r e t h a n t h e history of its tech-niques. M n e m o s y n e , said t h e Greeks, is t h e m o t h e r of t h e M u s e s ;
t h e history of t h e training of this m o s t fundamental a n d elusive of
h u m a n powers will plunge us into deep waters.
M y interest in t h e subject began a b o u t fifteen years ago w h e n I
hopefully set out to try to u n d e r s t a n d Giordano Bruno's works o n
m e m o r y . T h e m e m o r y system excavated from Bruno's Shadows
(Pl. II) was first displayed in a lecture at t h e W a r b u r g Institute in
M a y , 1952. T w o years later, in January, 1955, t h e plan of Giulio
Camillo's M e m o r y T h e a t r e (see Folder) was exhibited, also at a
lecture at t h e W a r b u r g Institute. I h a d realised b y this t i m e t h a t
there was some historical connection between Camillo's T h e a t r e ,
Bruno's a n d Campanella's systems, a n d R o b e r t F l u d d ' s T h e a t r e
system, all of which were compared, very superficially, at this
lecture. Encouraged b y w h a t seemed a slight progress, I began to
write t h e history of t h e art of m e m o r y from Simonides onwards.
T h i s stage was reflected in a n article o n ' T h e Ciceronian A r t of
M e m o r y ' which was published in Italy in t h e volume of studies in
h o n o u r of B r u n o N a r d i (Medioevo e Rinascimento,
Florence,
1955).

PREFACE
After this there was a rather long halt, caused by a difficulty. I
could not u n d e r s t a n d what h a p p e n e d to t h e art of m e m o r y in t h e
M i d d l e Ages. W h y did Albertus M a g n u s and T h o m a s Aquinas
regard t h e use in m e m o r y of t h e places and images of ' T u l l i u s ' as a
moral a n d religious d u t y ? T h e w o r d ' m n e m o t e c h n i c s ' seemed in-adequate to cover t h e scholastic recommendation of t h e art of
m e m o r y as a p a r t of the cardinal virtue of prudence. Gradually t h e
idea began to dawn that t h e M i d d l e Ages m i g h t think of figures of
virtues and vices as m e m o r y images, formed according to t h e clas-sical rules, or of t h e divisions of D a n t e ' s Hell as m e m o r y places.
Attempts to tackle t h e mediaeval transformation of t h e classical
art were m a d e in lectures on ' T h e Classical A r t of M e m o r y in t h e
M i d d l e Ages' given to t h e Oxford Mediaeval Society in M a r c h ,
1958, and on 'Rhetoric a n d t h e A r t of M e m o r y ' at t h e W a r b u r g
Institute in D e c e m b e r 1959. Parts of these lectures are incorpo-rated in chapters I V a n d V.
T h e greatest p r o b l e m of all remained, t h e p r o b l e m of t h e
Renaissance magical or occult m e m o r y systems. W h y , w h e n t h e
invention of printing seemed to have m a d e t h e great G o t h i c
artificial memories of t h e M i d d l e Ages n o longer necessary, was
there this recrudescence of t h e interest in t h e art of m e m o r y in t h e
strange forms in which we find it in t h e Renaissance systems of
Camillo, B r u n o , and F l u d d ? I r e t u r n e d to t h e study of Giulio
Camillo's M e m o r y T h e a t r e a n d realised that t h e stimulus b e h i n d
Renaissance occult m e m o r y was t h e Renaissance H e r m e t i c tradi-tion. I t also became apparent that it would b e necessary to write a
book on this tradition before one could tackle t h e Renaissance
m e m o r y systems. T h e Renaissance chapters in this book d e p e n d
for their background on m y Giordano Bruno amd the Hermetic
Tradition ( L o n d o n and Chicago, 1964).
I h a d t h o u g h t t h a t it m i g h t have been possible to keep Lullism
out of this book and treat it separately, b u t it soon became
clear that this was impossible. T h o u g h Lullism does not come
out of t h e rhetoric tradition, like t h e classical art of m e m o r y ,
a n d t h o u g h its procedures are very different, yet it is, in o n e
of its aspects, an art of m e m o r y and as such it becomes conflated
and confused with t h e classical art at t h e Renaissance. T h e
interpretation of Lullism given in chapter V I I I is based on m y
articles ' T h e A r t of R a m o n L u l l : A n A p p r o a c h to it t h r o u g h L u l l ' s
T h e o r y of t h e Elements', a n d ' R a m o n L u l l a n d J o h n Scotus

PREFACE
Erigena', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, X V I I
(1954) a n d X X I I I (1960).
T h e r e is n o m o d e r n book in English o n t h e history of t h e art of
m e m o r y a n d very few books or articles on it in any language. W h e n
I began, m y chief aids were some old monographs in G e r m a n a n d
t h e later G e r m a n studies by H . Hajdu, 1936, a n d L . Volkmann,
1937 (for full references, see p . 105). I n i 9 6 0 , Paolo Rossi's Clavis
universalis was published. T h i s book, which is in Italian, is a
serious historical study of t h e art of m e m o r y ; it prints a good deal
of source material, and contains discussions of Camillo's T h e a t r e ,
of Bruno's works, of Lullism, and m u c h else. I t has been valuable
to m e , particularly for t h e seventeenth century, t h o u g h it is o n
quite different lines from this book. I have also consulted Rossi's
n u m e r o u s articles and one b y Cesare Vasoli (references on p p . 105,
184, 194). O t h e r books which have particularly helped m e are
H . Caplan's edition of Ad Herennium (1954); W . S. Howell,
Logic and Rhetoric in England, 1500–1700 (1956); W . J. O n g ,
Ramus; Method and the Decay of Dialogue (1958); Beryl Smalley,
English Friars and Antiquity (1960).
T h o u g h it uses a good deal of earlier work, this book in its
present form is a n e w work, entirely rewritten and expanded in
fresh directions during t h e past two years. M u c h t h a t was obscure
seems to have fallen into better shape, particularly t h e connections
of t h e art of m e m o r y with Lullism a n d R a m i s m a n d t h e emergence
of ' m e t h o d ' . Moreover what is perhaps one of t h e most exciting
parts of t h e book has become p r o m i n e n t only quite recently.
T h i s is t h e realisation t h a t F l u d d ' s T h e a t r e m e m o r y system can
t h r o w light o n Shakespeare's G l o b e T h e a t r e . T h e imaginary
architecture of t h e art of m e m o r y has preserved t h e m e m o r y
of a real, b u t long vanished, building.
Like m y Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, t h e present
book is orientated towards placing B r u n o in a historical context b u t
also aims at giving a survey of a whole tradition. I t particularly
endeavours to t h r o w light, t h r o u g h t h e history of m e m o r y , o n t h e
n a t u r e of t h e impact which B r u n o m a y have m a d e o n Elizabethan
England. I have tried to strike out a pathway t h r o u g h a vast subject
b u t at every stage t h e picture which I have d r a w n needs to b e
supplemented or corrected b y further studies. T h i s is a n i m m e n s e l y
rich field for research, needing t h e collaboration of specialists in
m a n y disciplines.

PREFACE
N o w that the M e m o r y Book is at last ended, t h e m e m o r y of t h e
late G e r t r u d Bing seems m o r e poignantly present t h a n ever. I n t h e
early days, she read a n d discussed m y drafts, watching constantly
over m y progress, or lack of progress, encouraging a n d discourag-ing b y t u r n s , ever stimulating with her intense interest and vigilant
criticism. She felt that t h e problems of t h e mental image, of t h e
activation of images, of t h e grasp of reality t h r o u g h images—
problems ever present in t h e history of t h e art of m e m o r y — w e r e
close to those which preoccupied A b y W a r b u r g , w h o m I only
knew t h r o u g h her. W h e t h e r this book is w h a t she h o p e d for I can
n o w never know. She did n o t see even t h e first three chapters of it
which were about to b e sent to h e r w h e n she was taken ill. I dedi-cate it to her m e m o r y , with deep gratitude for h e r friendship.
M y debt to m y colleagues a n d friends of t h e W a r b u r g Institute,
University of L o n d o n , is, as always, profound. T h e Director, E. H .
G o m b r i c h , has always taken a stimulating interest in m y labours
a n d m u c h is owed to his wisdom. I believe t h a t it was h e w h o first
p u t into m y h a n d s L'Idea del Theatro of Giulio Camillo. T h e r e
have been m a n y invaluable discussions with D . P . Walker
whose specialist knowledge of certain aspects of the Renaissance
has been of constant assistance. H e read t h e early drafts a n d
has also read this book in manuscript, kindly checking some of
m y translations. W i t h J. T r a p p there have been talks about t h e
rhetoric tradition, and h e has been a m i n e of bibliographical
information. Some iconographical problems were laid before
L . Ettlinger.
All t h e librarians have been endlessly patient with m y efforts to
find books. A n d t h e staff of t h e photographic collection has shown
similar forbearance with m y efforts to find photographs.
I a m grateful for t h e comradeship of J. Hillgarth a n d R. P r i n g Mill in L u l l studies. A n d to Elspeth Jaffé, w h o knows m u c h a b o u t
arts of m e m o r y , for past conversations.
M y sister, R. W . Yates, has read t h e chapters as they were
written. H e r reactions to t h e m have been a most valuable guide a n d
h e r clever advice of great help in revisions. W i t h unfailing good
h u m o u r she has given untiring assistance in countless ways. S h e
has contributed above all to t h e plans and sketches. She drew t h e
plan of Camillo's T h e a t r e a n d t h e sketch of t h e G l o b e based o n
F l u d d . T h e suggested plan of t h e Globe is very largely h e r work.
W e shared together t h e excitement of the reconstruction of t h e

The book owes to her one of its greatest debts.
I have constantly used the London Library to whose staff I am
deeply grateful. And it goes without saying that the same is true of
the library of the British Museum and its staff. I am also indebted
to the librarians of the Bodleian Library, the Cambridge Univer-sity Library, the library of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and of
the following libraries abroad: Biblioteca Nazionale, Florence;
Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan; Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris;

a banquet given by a nobleman of Thessaly named
Scopas, the poet Simonides of Ceos chanted a lyric
poem in honour of his host but including a passage in
praise of Castor and Pollux. Scopas meanly told the
poet that he would only pay him half the sum agreed upon for the
panegyric and that he must obtain the balance from the twin gods
to whom he had devoted half the poem. A little later, a message was
brought in to Simonides that two young men were waiting outside
who wished to see him. He rose from the banquet and went out but
could find no one. During his absence the roof of the banqueting
hall fell in, crushing Scopas and all the guests to death beneath the
ruins; the corpses were so mangled that the relatives who came to

The English translations of the three Latin sources used are those in
the Loeb edition of the classics: the Ad Herennium is translated by H.
Caplan; the De oratore by E. W. Sutton and H. Rackham; Quintilian's
Institutio oratoria by H. E. Butler. When quoting from these translations
I have sometimes modified them in the direction of literalness, particu-larly in repeating the actual terminology of the mnemonic rather than in
using periphrases of the terms.
The best account known to me of the art of memory in antiquity is
that given by H. Hajdu, Das MnemotechnischeSchriftumdes Mittelalters,
Vienna, 1936. I attempted a brief sketch of it in my article 'The Cicero-nian Art of Memory' in Medioeve e Rinascimento, Studi in onore di Bruno

THREE LATIN SOURCES FOR THE CLASSICAL ART OF MEMORY
m u s t refer back constantly to this text as t h e m a i n source of t h e
tradition. Every Ars memorativa treatise, with its rules for 'places',
its rules for 'images', its discussion of ' m e m o r y for things' a n d
' m e m o r y for w o r d s ' , is repeating t h e plan, t h e subject matter, a n d
as often as n o t t h e actual words of Ad Herennium. A n d t h e astonish-ing developments of t h e art of m e m o r y in t h e sixteenth century,
which it is t h e chief object of this book to explore, still preserve t h e
' A d H e r e n n i a n ' outlines below all their complex accretions. E v e n
t h e wildest flights of fancy in such a work as Giordano B r u n o ' s
De umbris idearum cannot conceal t h e fact that t h e philosopher of
t h e Renaissance is going t h r o u g h yet once again t h e old, old
business of rules for places, rules for images, m e m o r y for things,
m e m o r y for words.
Evidently, therefore, it is i n c u m b e n t u p o n us to a t t e m p t t h e b y
n o means easy task of trying t o u n d e r s t a n d t h e m e m o r y section of
Ad Herennium. W h a t makes t h e task b y n o means easy is that t h e
rhetoric teacher is not addressing u s ; h e is n o t setting out to
explain to people who know nothing about it what t h e artificial
m e m o r y was. H e is addressing his rhetoric students as they
congregated a r o u n d h i m circa 86–82 B.C., a n d they knew what h e
was talking a b o u t ; for them h e needed only to rattle off t h e 'rules'
which they would know h o w to apply. W e are in a different case
a n d are often somewhat baffled by the strangeness of some of t h e
m e m o r y rules.
I n what follows I attempt to give t h e content of t h e m e m o r y
section of Ad Herennium, emulating t h e brisk style of t h e author,
b u t with pauses for reflection about what h e is telling u s .
T h e artificial m e m o r y is established from places a n d images
(Constat igitur artificiosa memoria ex locis et imaginibus), t h e stock
definition to b e forever repeated d o w n t h e ages. A locus is a place
easily grasped b y t h e m e m o r y , such as a house, an intercolumnar
space, a corner, an arch, or t h e like. Images are forms, marks or
simulacra (formae, notae, simulacra) of what we wish to r e m e m b e r .
F o r instance if we wish to recall t h e genus of a horse, of a lion, of an
eagle, we m u s t place their images on definite loci.
T h e art of m e m o r y is like an inner writing. T h o s e w h o know t h e
letters of t h e alphabet can write d o w n w h a t is dictated to t h e m a n d
read out what they have written. Likewise those w h o have learned
mnemonics can set in places what they have heard a n d deliver it
6

THREE LATIN SOURCES FOR THE CLASSICAL ART OF MEMORY
from m e m o r y . T o r t h e places are very m u c h like wax tablets or
p a p y r u s , t h e images like t h e letters, t h e arrangement a n d disposi-tion of t h e images like the script, a n d t h e delivery is like t h e
reading.'
I f we wish to r e m e m b e r m u c h material we m u s t e q u i p ourselves
w i t h a large n u m b e r of places. I t is essential t h a t t h e places should
form a series a n d m u s t b e r e m e m b e r e d in their order, so t h a t w e
can start from any locus in t h e series a n d m o v e either backwards
or forwards from it. I f w e should see a n u m b e r of o u r acquain-tances standing in a row, it would n o t make any difference to u s
whether w e should tell their n a m e s beginning w i t h t h e person
standing at t h e head of t h e line or at t h e foot or in t h e middle. So
with m e m o r y loci. ' I f these have b e e n arranged in order, t h e result
will b e that, r e m i n d e d b y t h e images, we can repeat orally w h a t we
have committed to t h e loci, proceeding in either direction from any
locus w e please.'
T h e formation of t h e loci is of t h e greatest importance, for t h e
same set of loci can b e used again a n d again for r e m e m b e r i n g
different material. T h e images which we have placed o n t h e m for
r e m e m b e r i n g one set of things fade a n d are effaced w h e n we make
n o further use of t h e m . B u t t h e loci remain in t h e m e m o r y a n d
can b e used again b y placing another set of images for another set
of material. T h e loci are like t h e wax tablets w h i c h remain w h e n
w h a t is written on t h e m has been effaced a n d are ready to b e
written on again.
I n order to m a k e sure t h a t w e d o n o t err in r e m e m b e r i n g t h e
order of t h e loci it is useful to give each fifth locus some distinguish-ing mark. W e m a y for example m a r k t h e fifth locus with a golden
h a n d , a n d place in t h e t e n t h t h e image of some acquaintance whose
n a m e is D e c i m u s . W e can t h e n go o n to station other marks o n
each succeeding fifth locus.
I t is better to form one's m e m o r y loci in a deserted a n d solitary
place for crowds of passing people t e n d to weaken t h e impressions.
Therefore t h e s t u d e n t intent on acquiring a sharp a n d welldefined set of loci will choose a n unfrequented building in w h i c h t o
memorise places.
M e m o r y loci should n o t b e too m u c h like one another, for
instance too m a n y intercolumnar spaces are n o t good, for their
resemblance to one another will b e confusing. T h e y should b e of
moderate size, not too large for this renders t h e images placed

THREE LATIN SOURCES FOR THE CLASSICAL ART OF MEMORY
Like Cicero, h e introduces his account of it with t h e story of its
invention b y Simonides of which h e gives a version which is in t h e
main t h e same as t h a t told b y Cicero t h o u g h with some variant
details. H e adds that there were a good m a n y versions of t h e story
in Greek authorities and that its wide circulation in his own day is
d u e to Cicero.
This achievement of Simonides appears to have given rise to the
observation that it is an assistance to the memory if places are
stamped upon the mind, which anyone can believe from experi-ment. For when we return to a place after a considerable absence,
we not merely recognise the place itself, but remember things that
we did there, and recall the persons whom we met and even the
unuttered thoughts which passed through our minds when we were
there before. Thus, as in most cases, art originates from experiment.
Places are chosen, and marked with the utmost possible variety,
as a spacious house divided into a number of rooms. Everything
of note therein is diligently imprinted on the mind, in order that
thought may be able to run through all the parts without let or
hindrance. T h e first task is to secure that there shall be no diffi-culty in running through these, for that memory must be most
firmly fixed which helps another memory. Then what has been
written down, or thought of, is noted by a sign to remind of it.
This sign may be drawn from a whole 'thing', as navigation or
warfare, or from some 'word'; for what is slipping from memory
is recovered by the admonition of a single word. However, let us
suppose that the sign is drawn from navigation, as, for instance,
an anchor; or from warfare, as, for example, a weapon. These
signs are then arranged as follows. T h e first notion is placed, as it
were, in the forecourt; the second, let us say, in the atrium; the
remainder are placed in order all round the impluvium, and com-mitted not only to bedrooms and parlours, but even to statues and
the like. This done, when it is required to revive the memory,
one begins from the first place to run through all, demanding what
has been entrusted to them, of which one will be reminded by the
image. Thus, however numerous are the particulars which it is
required to remember, all are linked one to another as in a chorus
nor can what follows wander from what has gone before to which
it is joined, only the preliminary labour of learning being required.
What I have spoken of as being done in a house can also be done
in public buildings, or on a long journey, or in going through a
city, or with pictures. Or we can imagine such places for ourselves.
We require therefore places, either real or imaginary, and images

THE

Simonides story, with its gruesome evocation of the
faces of the people sitting in their places at the b a n q u e t
just before their awful end, may suggest that the h u m a n
images were an integral part of the art of m e m o r y which
Greece transmitted to R o m e . According to Quintilian, there were
several versions of the story extant in Greek sources, 1 and one may
perhaps conjecture that it formed the normal introduction to the
section on artificial m e m o r y in a text-book on rhetoric. T h e r e were
certainly m a n y such in Greek b u t they have not come down to us,
hence our dependence on the three Latin sources for any conjec-tures we may make concerning Greek artificial memory.
Simonides of Ceos 2 (circa 556 to 468 B.C.) belongs to the p r e Socratic age. Pythagoras might still have been alive in his youth.
O n e of the most admired lyric poets of Greece (very little of his
poetry has survived) h e was called ' t h e honey-tongued', Latinised
1
Quintilian says (Institutio oratoria, XI, ii, 14–16) that there is dis-agreement among the Greek sources as to whether the banquet was held
'at Pharsalus, as Simonides himself seems to indicate in a certain passage,
and is recorded by Apollodorus, Eratosthenes, Euphorion and Eurypylus
of Larissa, or at Crannon, as is stated by Apollas Callimachus, who is
followed by Cicero.'
2
A collection of references to Simonides in ancient literature is
brought together in Lyra Graeca, edited and translated by J. M. Edmonds,
Loeb Classical Library, Vol. II (1924), pp. 246 ff.

THE ART OF MEMORY IN GREECE: MEMORY AND THE SOUL
seasons. O r t h e passage m a y b e corrupt and fundamentally
incomprehensible as it stands.
I t is immediately followed by one in which Aristotle is speaking
of recollecting t h r o u g h starting at any one point in a series.
Generally speaking the middle point seems to be a good point
to start from; for one will recollect when one comes to this point,
if not before, or else one will not recollect from any other. For
instance, suppose one were thinking of a series, which may be
represented by the letters A B C D E F G H ; if one does not recall what
is wanted at E, yet one does at H ; from that point it is possible to
travel in either direction, that is either towards D or towards F.
Supposing one is seeking for either G or F, one will recollect on
arriving at c, if one wants G or F. If not then on arrival at A. Suc-cess is always achieved in this way. Sometimes it is possible to
recall what we seek and sometimes not; the reason being that it is
possible to travel from the same starting-point in more than one
direction; for instance from c we may go direct to F or only to D. 2 4
Since t h e starting-point in a train of recollection has earlier been
likened to t h e m n e m o n i c locus, we m a y recall in connection with
this pretty confusing passage that one of t h e advantages of t h e
artificial m e m o r y was that its possessor could start at any point in
his places a n d r u n t h r o u g h t h e m in any direction.
T h e scholastics proved to their own satisfaction that t h e De
memoria et reminiscentia provided philosophical justification for t h e
artificial m e m o r y . I t is however very doubtful whether this is what
Aristotle meant. H e appears to use his references to the m n e m o n i c
technique only as illustrations of his argument.
T h e m e t a p h o r , used in all three of our Latin sources for the
m n e m o n i c , which compares t h e inner writing or stamping of t h e
m e m o r y images on t h e places with writing on a waxed tablet is
obviously suggested b y t h e contemporary use of the waxed tablet
for writing. Nevertheless it also connects t h e m n e m o n i c with
ancient theory of m e m o r y , as Quintilian saw w h e n , in his intro-duction to his t r e a t m e n t of t h e m n e m o n i c , h e remarked t h a t h e did
not propose to dwell on t h e precise functions of m e m o r y , 'although

THE ART OF MEMORY IN GREECE: MEMORY AND THE SOUL
m a n y hold t h e view that certain impressions are m a d e on t h e m i n d ,
analogous to those which a signet ring makes on wax.' 2 5
Aristotle's use of this m e t a p h o r for t h e images from sense
impressions, which are like t h e i m p r i n t of a seal on wax, has already
been quoted. F o r Aristotle such impressions are the basic source
of all knowledge; t h o u g h refined u p o n and abstracted by t h e think-ing intellect, there could b e no t h o u g h t or knowledge without t h e m ,
for all knowledge depends on sense impressions.
Plato also uses t h e seal imprint metaphor in the famous passage
in t h e Theaetetus in which Socrates assumes that there is a block of
wax in our souls—of varying quality in different individuals—and
that this is 'the gift of M e m o r y , t h e m o t h e r of the M u s e s ' . When-ever we see or hear or think of anything we hold this wax u n d e r the
perceptions and thoughts and i m p r i n t t h e m u p o n it, just as we
make impressions from seal rings. 2 6
But Plato, unlike Aristotle, believes that there is a knowledge not
derived from sense impressions, t h a t there are latent in our
memories t h e forms or moulds of t h e Ideas, of t h e realities which
t h e soul knew before its descent here below. T r u e knowledge
consists in fitting the imprints from sense impressions on to the
m o u l d or imprint of the higher reality of which t h e things here
below are reflections. T h e Phaedo develops t h e argument that all
sensible objects are referable to certain types of which they are
likenesses. W e have not seen or learned t h e types in this life; b u t
we saw t h e m before our life began and the knowledge of t h e m is
innate in our memories. T h e example given is that of referring our
sense perceptions of objects which are equal to the Idea of Equality
which is innate in u s . W e perceive equality in equal subjects, such
as equal pieces of wood, because t h e Idea of Equality has been
impressed on our memories, t h e seal of it is latent in t h e wax of our
soul. T r u e knowledge consists in fitting t h e imprints from sense
impressions on to t h e basic imprint or seal of t h e F o r m or Idea to
which t h e objects of sense correspond. 2 7 I n the Phaedrus, in which
Plato expounds his view of t h e t r u e function of rhetoric—which is
to persuade m e n to t h e knowledge of t h e t r u t h — h e again develops
t h e t h e m e that knowledge of the t r u t h a n d of t h e soul consists in
remembering, in t h e recollection of the Ideas once seen b y all souls

THE ART OF MEMORY IN GREECE! MEMORY AND THE SOUL
of which all earthly things are confused copies. All knowledge and
all learning are an attempt to recollect t h e realities, the collecting
into a unity of t h e m a n y perceptions of t h e senses t h r o u g h their
correspondencies with the realities. ' I n t h e earthly copies of justice
a n d temperance and the other ideas which are precious to souls
there is n o light, b u t only a few, approaching t h e images t h r o u g h
t h e darkling organs of sense, behold in t h e m the nature of that
which they imitate.' 2 8
T h e Phaedrus is a treatise on rhetoric in which rhetoric is
regarded, not as an art of persuasion to b e used for personal or
political advantage, b u t as an art of speaking t h e t r u t h and of
persuading hearers to t h e t r u t h . T h e power to do this depends on a
knowledge of t h e soul and the soul's t r u e knowledge consists in t h e
recollection of t h e Ideas. M e m o r y is n o t a 'section' of this treatise,
as one part of t h e art of rhetoric; m e m o r y in the Platonic sense is
t h e groundwork of t h e whole.
It is clear that, from Plato's point of view, t h e artificial m e m o r y
as used b y a sophist would b e anathema, a desecration of m e m o r y .
It is indeed possible that some of Plato's satire on t h e sophists, for
instance their senseless use of etymologies, might b e explicable
from t h e sophist m e m o r y treatise, with its use of such etymologies
for m e m o r y for words. A Platonic m e m o r y would have to b e
organised, not in t h e trivial m a n n e r of such mnemotechnics, b u t in
relation to t h e realities.
T h e grandiose attempt to do just this, within the framework of
t h e art of m e m o r y , was m a d e by the Neoplatonists of t h e Renais-sance. O n e of t h e most striking manifestations of t h e Renaissance
use of t h e art is the M e m o r y T h e a t r e of Giulio Camillo. U s i n g
images disposed on places in a neoclassical theatre—that is using t h e
technique of t h e artificial m e m o r y in a perfectly correct way—
Camillo's m e m o r y system is based (so h e believes) on archetypes
of reality on which d e p e n d secondary images covering t h e whole
realm of n a t u r e and of m a n . Camillo's view of m e m o r y is funda-mentally Platonic (though H e r m e t i c and Cabalist influences are also
present in t h e T h e a t r e ) and h e aims at constructing an artificial
m e m o r y based on t r u t h . ' N o w if the ancient orators,' h e says,
'wishing to place from day to day the parts of t h e speech which
they h a d to recite, confided t h e m to frail places as frail things, it

time in high favour, t h o u g h Plutarch hints that h e was eventually
p u t out of t h e way b y his brilliant b u t cruel master.
W e know from Strabo that M e t r o d o r u s was t h e author of a
work, or works, on rhetoric. ' F r o m Scepsis', says Strabo, 'came
M e t r o d o r u s , a m a n w h o changed from his pursuit of philosophy to
political life, and taught rhetoric, for t h e most part, in his written
w o r k s ; and h e used a b r a n d new style and dazzled m a n y . ' 3 6 I t m a y
b e inferred that M e t r o d o r u s ' rhetoric was of t h e florid 'Asianist'
type, and it m a y well have been in his work or works on rhetoric,
u n d e r m e m o r y as a part of rhetoric, that h e expounded his
mnemonics. T h e lost works of M e t r o d o r u s m a y have been
amongst t h e Greek works on m e m o r y which t h e author of Ad
Herennium consulted; Cicero and Quintilian may have read t h e m .
But all that we have to build on is Quintilian's statement that
M e t r o d o r u s 'found three h u n d r e d and sixty places in t h e twelve
signs t h r o u g h which t h e s u n moves'. A m o d e r n writer, L . A. Post,
has discussed t h e n a t u r e of M e t r o d o r u s ' memory-system, as
follows:
I suspect that Metrodorus was versed in astrology, for astrologers
divided the zodiac not only into 12 signs, but also into 36 decans,
each covering ten degrees; for each decan there was an associated
decan-figure. Metrodorus probably grouped ten artificial back-grounds (loci) under each decan figure. He would thus have a
series of loci numbered 1 to 360, which he could use in his opera-tions. With a little calculation he could find any background (locus)
by its number, and he was insured against missing a background,
since all were arranged in numerical order. His system was there-fore well designed for the performance of striking feats of
memory. 37
Post assumes that M e t r o d o r u s used t h e astrological images as
places which would ensure order in m e m o r y , just as t h e normal
places memorised in buildings ensured r e m e m b e r i n g the images
on t h e m , and t h e things or words associated with t h e m , in t h e right
order. T h e order of the signs, Aries, T a u r u s , G e m i n i , a n d so on
gives at once an easily memorised o r d e r ; and if M e t r o d o r u s also

m a n w h o marked d o w n t h e paths of the wandering stars. Earlier
still, there were ' t h e m e n w h o discovered t h e fruits of t h e earth,
raiment, dwellings, an ordered way of life, protection against wild
creatures—men u n d e r whose civilising and refining influence we
have gradually passed on from t h e indispensable handicrafts to t h e
finer arts.' T o t h e art, for example, of music and its ' d u e combina-tions of musical sounds'. A n d to t h e discovery of t h e revolution
of the heavens, such as Archimedes m a d e w h e n h e 'fastened o n a
globe t h e movements of m o o n , sun, a n d five wandering stars'. T h e n
there are still m o r e famous fields of l a b o u r ; poetry, eloquence,
philosophy.
A power able to bring about such a number of important results is to
my mind wholly divine. For what is the memory of things and words ?
What further is invention ? (Quid est enim memoria rerum et verborum? quid porro inventio?) Assuredly nothing can be appre-hended even in God of greater value than this . . . Therefore the
soul is, as I say, divine, as Euripides dares say, God . . . 4 7
M e m o r y for t h i n g s ; m e m o r y for w o r d s ! I t is surely significant t h a t
t h e technical terms of t h e artificial m e m o r y come into t h e orator's
m i n d w h e n , as philosopher, h e is proving t h e divinity of t h e soul.
T h a t proof falls u n d e r t h e heads of t h e parts of rhetoric, memoria
and inventio. T h e soul's remarkable power of r e m e m b e r i n g things
and words is a proof of its divinity; so also is its power of invention,
not n o w in t h e sense of inventing t h e arguments or things of a
speech, b u t in t h e general sense of invention or discovery. T h e
things over which Cicero ranges as inventions represent a history
of h u m a n civilisation from t h e most primitive to t h e most highly
developed ages. ( T h e ability to do this would b e in itself evidence
of t h e power of m e m o r y ; in t h e rhetorical theory, t h e things
invented are stored in t h e treasure house of memory.) T h u s
memoria and inventio in t h e sense in which they are used in t h e
Tusculan Disputations are transposed from parts of rhetoric into
divisions u n d e r which t h e divinity of t h e soul is proved, in accord-ance with t h e Platonic presuppositions of t h e orator's philosophy.
I n this work, Cicero probably has in m i n d t h e perfect orator,
as defined b y his master Plato in t h e Phaedrus, t h e orator w h o
knows t h e t r u t h a n d knows t h e n a t u r e of t h e soul, a n d so is able

M i d d l e Ages t h e outline of the ancient educational system based on

THE ART OF MEMORY IN THE MIDDLE AGES
Aristotle calls reminiscence. ' W h a t h e [Tullius] says of artificial
m e m o r y which is confirmed b y induction a n d rational p r e c e p t . . .
belongs n o t to m e m o r y b u t to reminiscence, as Aristotle says in t h e
book De memoria et reminiscentia.' 30 T h u s we have at t h e start t h e
conflation of Aristotle on reminiscence with Ad Herennium on
m e m o r y training. So far as I know, Albertus was t h e first to make
this conflation.
T h e n come t h e precepts, beginning, of course, with rules for
places. Discussing t h e phrase in Ad Herennium describing good
m e m o r y places as standing out 'breviter, perfecte, insigniter aut
n a t u r a aut m a n u ' , Albertus asks h o w can a place b e at t h e same
t i m e b o t h 'brevis' a n d perfectus' ? Tullius seems to b e contradict-ing himself h e r e . 3 1 T h e solution is that b y a 'brevis' place Tullius
means that it should n o t 'distend t h e soul' b y carrying it t h r o u g h
'imaginary spaces as a camp or city'. 3 2 O n e deduces from this that
Albertus himself advises t h e use of only 'real' m e m o r y places,
memorised in real buildings, n o t t h e erection of imaginary systems
in m e m o r y . Since h e has mentioned in t h e previous solution t h a t
'solemn a n d rare' m e m o r y places are t h e most ' m o v i n g ' , 3 3 perhaps
one can further deduce that t h e best kind of building in which to
form m e m o r y places would b e a church.
Again, what does Tullius m e a n b y saying that t h e places should
b e memorable 'aut natura aut m a n u ' ? 3 4 Tullius should have de-fined what h e means b y this which h e nowhere does. T h e solution
is that a place memorable b y n a t u r e is, for example, a field; a place
memorable b y h a n d is a building. 3 5
:
T h e five rules for choosing places are n o w quoted, namely ( i ) in
quiet spots to avoid disturbance of t h e intense concentration
needed for m e m o r i s i n g ; (2) n o t too m u c h alike, for example n o t
too m a n y identical intercolumniations; (3) neither too large nor too
small; (4) neither too brightly lighted n o r too o b s c u r e ; (5) with
intervals between t h e m of moderate extent, about thirty feet. 3 6 I t is
objected that these precepts do n o t cover current m e m o r y practice,
for ' M a n y people r e m e m b e r t h r o u g h dispositions of places con-trary to those described'. 3 7 B u t t h e solution is that Tullius means

N o w Albertus t u r n s to t h e precepts for ' t h e images which are to
b e p u t in t h e said places'. T u l l i u s says t h a t t h e r e are two kinds of
images, one for things, t h e other for words. M e m o r y for things
seeks to r e m i n d of notions only b y i m a g e s ; m e m o r y for words
seeks t o r e m e m b e r every w o r d b y m e a n s of a n image. W h a t
Tullius advises would seem to b e an i m p e d i m e n t rather t h a n a h e l p
to m e m o r y ; first, because one would need as m a n y images as t h e r e
are notions a n d words a n d this m u l t i t u d e would confuse m e m o r y ;
secondly because metaphors represent a t h i n g less accurately t h a n
t h e description of t h e actual t h i n g itself (metaphorica minus
repraesentant rem quam propria). B u t T u l l i u s would have us trans-late t h e propria into metaphorica for t h e p u r p o s e of r e m e m b e r i n g ,
saying, for example, t h a t to r e m e m b e r a law-suit i n which a m a n is
accused of having poisoned another m a n for a n inheritance, t h e r e
being m a n y witnesses t o his guilt, o n e should place in m e m o r y ,
images of a sick m a n i n b e d , t h e accused m a n standing b y it
holding a c u p a n d a d o c u m e n t , a n d a doctor holding t h e testicles
of a r a m . (Albertus has interpreted medicus, t h e fourth finger, as a
doctor a n d so introduced a t h i r d person into t h e scene.) B u t m i g h t
it n o t have b e e n easier to r e m e m b e r all this t h r o u g h t h e actual
facts (propria) rather t h a n t h r o u g h these metaphors (metapho-rica)?45
W e salute Albertus M a g n u s across t h e ages for having h a d wor-ries about t h e classical art of m e m o r y so like o u r own. B u t his
solution entirely reverses this criticism o n t h e g r o u n d s ( i ) t h a t
images are an aid to m e m o r y ; (2) t h a t m a n y propria can b e remem-b e r e d t h r o u g h a few i m a g e s ; (3) t h a t although t h e propria
give m o r e exact information a b o u t t h e t h i n g itself, yet t h e
metaphorica ' m o v e t h e soul m o r e a n d therefore better h e l p t h e
memory'.46
H e next struggles with t h e memory-for-words images of D o m i tius being beaten u p b y t h e Reges, a n d of Aesop a n d C i m b e r
dressing u p for their parts in t h e play of Iphigeneia.47 His task was

pages of t h e c o m m e n t a r y : 'Nihil potest h o m o intelligere sine
p h a n t a s m a t e . ' 6 3 W h a t t h e n is m e m o r y ? It is in t h e sensitive p a r t of
t h e soul which takes t h e images of sense impressions; it therefore
belongs to t h e same part of t h e soul as imagination, b u t is also
per accidens in t h e intellectual part since the abstracting intellect
works in it on t h e phantasmata.
It is manifest from the preceding to what part of the soul memory
belongs, that is to say to the same (part) as phantasy. And those
things are per se memorable of which there is a phantasy, that is to
say, the sensibilia. But the intelligibilia are per accidens memorable,
for these cannot be apprehended by man without a phantasm. And
thus it is that we remember less easily those things which are of
subtle and spiritual import; and we remember more easily those
things which are gross and sensible. And if we wish to remember
intelligible notions more easily, we should link them with some
kind of phantasms, as Tullius teaches in his Rhetoric. 64
I t has come, t h e inevitable reference to Tullius on t h e artificial
m e m o r y in t h e Second Rhetoric. A n d these phrases, curiously
overlooked b y m o d e r n T h o m i s t s b u t very famous a n d forever
quoted in t h e old m e m o r y tradition, give t h e T h o m i s t justification
for the use of images in t h e artificial m e m o r y . I t is as a concession
to h u m a n weakness, to t h e n a t u r e of t h e soul, which will take
easily a n d r e m e m b e r t h e images of gross a n d sensible things b u t
which cannot r e m e m b e r 'subtle a n d spiritual things' without an
image. Therefore we should do as T u l l i u s advises a n d link such
'things' with images if we wish to r e m e m b e r t h e m .
I n t h e later part of his commentary, Aquinas discusses t h e two
m a i n points of Aristotle's theory of reminiscence, that it depends
o n association a n d order. H e repeats from Aristotle t h e three laws
of association, giving examples, and h e emphasises t h e importance
of order. H e quotes Aristotle o n mathematical theorems being easy
to r e m e m b e r t h r o u g h their o r d e r ; and on t h e necessity of finding a
63

Ibid., p. 92. The commentary should be read in conjunction with the
psychology expounded in Aquinas' commentary on the De anima.
Aquinas was using the Latin translation of Aristotle by William of
Moerbeke in which Aristotle's statements are rendered as Numquam sine
phantasmate intelligit anima or intelligere non est sine phantasmate. An
English translation of the Latin translation which Aquinas used is given in
Aristotle's 'De anima? with the Commentary of St. Thomas Aquinas, trans.

THE ART OF MEMORY IN THE MIDDLE AGES
starting-point in m e m o r y from which reminiscence will proceed
t h r o u g h an associative order until it finds w h a t it is seeking. A n d
at this point, where Aristotle himself refers to t h e ΤÓΠOΙ of Greek
m n e m o n i c s , Aquinas brings in t h e loci of T u l l i u s .
It is necessary for reminiscence to take some starting-point, whence
one begins to proceed to reminisce. For this reason, some men may
be seen to reminisce from the places in which something was said
or done, or thought, using the place as it were as the starting-point
for reminiscence; because access to the place is like a starting-point
for all those things which were raised in it. Whence Tullius teaches
in his Rhetoric that for easy remembering one should imagine a
certain order of places upon which images (phantasmata) of all those
things which we wish to remember are distributed in a certain
order. 65
T h e places of t h e artificial m e m o r y are t h u s given a rational
grounding in Aristotelian theory of reminiscence based o n order
a n d association.
Aquinas t h u s continues Albertus' conflation of T u l l i u s with
Aristotle, b u t m o r e explicitly a n d in a m o r e carefully t h o u g h t o u t
way. A n d w e are at liberty to imagine t h e places a n d images of t h e
artificial m e m o r y as in some way t h e 'sensible' furniture of a m i n d
a n d a m e m o r y directed towards t h e intelligible world.
B u t Aquinas does n o t make t h e h a r d a n d fast distinction be-tween m e m o r y in t h e sensitive p a r t , a n d reminiscence (including
t h e artificial m e m o r y as a n art of reminiscence) in t h e intellectual
part of t h e soul on which Albertus h a d insisted. Reminiscence is
indeed peculiar t o m a n , whereas animals also have m e m o r y , a n d
its m e t h o d of proceeding from a starting-point can b e likened to
t h e m e t h o d of t h e syllogism in logic, a n d 'syllogizare est actus
rationis'. Nevertheless t h e fact t h a t m e n in trying t o r e m e m b e r
strike their heads a n d agitate their bodies (Aristotle h a d men-tioned this) shows that t h e act is partly corporeal. Its superior a n d
partly rational character is d u e — n o t to its being in n o way in t h e
sensitive p a r t — b u t to t h e superiority of t h e sensitive part in m a n ,
to that in animals, because m a n ' s rationality is used in it.
T h i s caution means t h a t Aquinas does n o t fall into t h e t r a p , into
which Albertus is beginning to fall, of regarding t h e artificial

interpretation of the Aristotle passage on transition from milk, to white,
to air, to autumn (see above, p. 34) as illustrating the laws of association.

its virtues and vices as 'memorial notes' t h r o u g h which we are to

Hell, a n d memorised as ranged in order in some 'solemn'
building.

progress r o u n d t h e building choosing t h e places, t h e images
r e m e m b e r e d on t h e places for reminding of t h e points of t h e speech
T h e mediaeval reader of Ad Herennium did n o t have t h a t advan-tage. H e read those queer rules for places and images without t h e
assistance of any other text o n t h e classical art of m e m o r y , and,
moreover, in an age w h e n t h e classical art of oratory h a d disap-peared, was n o longer practised. H e read t h e rules, n o t in associa-tion w i t h any living practice of oratory, b u t in close association
with t h e teaching of Tullius on ethics in t h e First Rhetoric. O n e
can see how misunderstandings might have arisen. A n d there is
even t h e possibility, as already suggested, t h a t an ethical, or
didactic, or religious use of t h e classical art m i g h t have arisen
m u c h earlier, m i g h t have been used in some early Christian
transformation of it of which we know nothing b u t which m i g h t
have been h a n d e d on to t h e early M i d d l e Ages. I t is therefore
probable that t h e p h e n o m e n o n which I call 'the mediaeval trans-formation of t h e classical art of m e m o r y ' was not invented b y
Albertus a n d T h o m a s b u t was already there long before t h e y
took it u p with renewed zeal a n d care.
T h e scholastic refurbishing of t h e art a n d strong recommenda-tion of it marks a very i m p o r t a n t point in its history, one of t h e
great peaks of its influence. A n d one can see h o w it belongs into
t h e general picture of thirteenth-century effort as a whole. T h e
aim of t h e learned Dominican friars, of w h o m T h o m a s a n d Alber-tus were such notable representatives, was to use t h e new Aristote-lian learning to preserve a n d defend the C h u r c h , and absorb it into
t h e C h u r c h , to re-examine t h e existing body of learning in its light.

THE ART OF MEMORY IN THE MIDDLE AGES
T h i s is a similar a r g u m e n t to that which justifies t h e use of images
in the artificial m e m o r y . I t is extremely curious t h a t those in search
of scholastic justification of the use of imagery in religious art
should have missed t h e elaborate analyses of w h y w e m a y use
images in m e m o r y given by Albertus a n d T h o m a s .
Something has been left out all along t h e line a n d it is M e m o r y .
M e m o r y which n o t only h a d i m m e n s e practical importance for t h e
m e n of ancient times, b u t also a religious and ethical importance.
Augustine, t h e great Christian rhetor, h a d m a d e M e m o r y one of
t h e three powers of t h e soul, a n d T u l l i u s — t h a t Christian soul
before Christianity—had m a d e it one of t h e three parts of Pru-dence. A n d Tullius h a d given advice as to h o w to m a k e ' t h i n g s '
memorable. I make so bold as to suggest t h a t Christian didactic art
which needs to set forth its teaching in a memorable way, which
m u s t show forth impressively t h e 'things' which make for virtuous
a n d unvirtuous conduct, m a y owe m o r e t h a n we know to classical
rules which have never been t h o u g h t of in this context, to those
striking imagines agentes which we have seen trooping out of t h e
rhetoric text book into a scholastic treatise on ethics.
T h e high G o t h i c cathedral, so E. Panofsky has suggested,
resembles a scholastic s u m m a in being arranged according to c a
system of homologous parts a n d parts of p a r t s ' . 7 1 T h e extra-ordinary t h o u g h t n o w arises t h a t if T h o m a s Aquinas memorised
his o w n Summa t h r o u g h 'corporeal similitudes' disposed o n places
following t h e order of its parts, t h e abstract Summa m i g h t b e
corporealised in m e m o r y into something like a G o t h i c cathedral
full of images on its ordered places. W e m u s t refrain from too
m u c h supposition, yet it remains an u n d o u b t e d fact that t h e Summa
contained, in an unnoticed p a r t of it, justification and encourage-m e n t for the use of imagery, a n d t h e creation of new imagery, in its
recommendation of t h e artificial m e m o r y .

tremendous recommendation of t h e art of memory,

t h e great saint of scholasticism was b o u n d to have far
reaching results. If Simonides was t h e inventor of the art
of m e m o r y , a n d ' T u l l i u s ' its teacher, T h o m a s Aquinas became
something like its patron saint. T h e following are a few examples,
culled from a m u c h larger mass of material, of how t h e n a m e of
T h o m a s dominated m e m o r y in later centuries.
I n t h e middle of t h e fifteenth century, Jacopo Ragone wrote an
Ars memorativa treatise; t h e opening words of its dedication to
Franceso Gonzaga a r e : ' M o s t illustrious Prince, t h e artificial
m e m o r y is perfected t h r o u g h two things, namely loci a n d imagines,
as Cicero teaches a n d as is confirmed b y St. T h o m a s A q u i n a s . ' 1
Later in t h e same century, in 1482, there appeared at Venice an
early and beautiful specimen of t h e printed b o o k ; it was a work on
rhetoric by Jacobus Publicius which contained as an appendix the
first printed Ars memorativa treatise. T h o u g h this book looks like a
Renaissance p r o d u c t it is full of t h e influence of T h o m i s t artificial
m e m o r y ; t h e rules for images begin with t h e w o r d s : ' S i m p l e and
spiritual intentions slip easily from t h e m e m o r y unless joined to
corporeal similitudes.' 2 O n e of t h e fullest a n d most widely cited of

MEDIAEVAL MEMORY AND THE FORMATION OF IMAGERY
T h u s a side of T h o m a s Aquinas w h o was venerated in the ages
of M e m o r y was still n o t forgotten even in t h e early nineteenth
century. I t is a side of h i m which, so far as I know, is never
mentioned b y m o d e r n T h o m i s t philosophers. A n d t h o u g h books
on t h e art of m e m o r y are aware of I I , I I , 49 as an i m p o r t a n t text
in its history, 1 1 n o very serious enquiry has been undertaken into
t h e n a t u r e of t h e influence of t h e T h o m i s t rules for m e m o r y .
W h a t were t h e results of t h e m o m e n t o u s recommendation b y
Albertus and T h o m a s of their revisions of t h e m e m o r y rules as a
part of P r u d e n c e ? A n enquiry into this should begin near t h e
source of t h e influence. I t was in t h e thirteenth century t h a t t h e
scholastic rules were promulgated, a n d we should expect to find
their influence at their greatest strength beginning at once and
carrying on in strength into t h e fourteenth century. I propose in
this chapter to raise t h e question of what was t h e n a t u r e of this
immediate influence a n d w h e r e we should look for its effects. I
cannot h o p e to answer it adequately, nor do I aim at m o r e t h a n
sketching possible answers, or rather possible lines of enquiry. I f
some of m y suggestions seem daring, they m a y at least provoke
t h o u g h t o n a t h e m e which has hardly been t h o u g h t about at all.
T h i s t h e m e is t h e role of t h e art of m e m o r y in t h e formation of
imagery.
T h e age of scholasticism was one in which knowledge increased.
I t was also an age of M e m o r y , and in t h e ages of M e m o r y new
imagery has to b e created for r e m e m b e r i n g new knowledge. T h o u g h
t h e great themes of Christian doctrine a n d moral teaching re-mained, of course, basically t h e same, they became m o r e compli-cated. I n particular t h e virtue-vice scheme grew m u c h fuller and
was m o r e strictly defined a n d organised. T h e moral m a n w h o
wished to choose t h e p a t h of virtue, whilst also r e m e m b e r i n g and
avoiding vice, h a d m o r e to i m p r i n t on m e m o r y t h a n in earlier
simpler times.
T h e friars revived oratory in t h e form of preaching, and

For example, H. Hajdu, Das Mnemotechnische Schrifttum des Mittelalters, Vienna, Amsterdam, Leipzig, 1936, pp. 68 ff.; Paolo Rossi,
Clavis Universalis, Milan-Naples, i960, pp. 12 ff. Rossi discusses Albertus

MEDIAEVAL MEMORY AND THE FORMATION OF IMAGERY
preaching was indeed t h e m a i n object for which t h e Dominican
O r d e r , t h e O r d e r of Preachers, was founded. Surely it would
have been for r e m e m b e r i n g sermons, t h e mediaeval transforma-tion of oratory, t h a t t h e mediaeval transformation of t h e artificial
m e m o r y would have been chiefly used.
T h e effort of D o m i n i c a n learning in t h e reform of preaching is
parallel to t h e great philosophical a n d theological effort of t h e
D o m i n i c a n schoolmen. T h e Summae of Albertus a n d T h o m a s
provide t h e abstract philosophical a n d theological definitions, a n d
in ethics t h e clear abstract statements, such as t h e divisions of t h e
virtues a n d vices into their parts. But t h e preacher needed another
t y p e of Summae to help h i m , Summae of examples a n d simili-t u d e s 1 2 t h r o u g h which h e could easily find corporeal forms in
which to clothe t h e spiritual intentions which h e wished to
impress on t h e souls a n d memories of his hearers.
T h e m a i n effort of this preaching was directed towards inculcat-ing t h e articles of t h e Faith, together with a severe ethic in which
virtue a n d vice are sharply outlined a n d polarised a n d enormous
emphasis is laid o n t h e rewards a n d p u n i s h m e n t s which await t h e
one a n d t h e other in t h e hereafter. 1 3 Such was t h e n a t u r e of t h e
'things' which t h e orator-preacher would need to memorise.
T h e earlist k n o w n quotation of T h o m a s ' s m e m o r y rules is found
i n a s u m m a of similitudes for t h e use of preachers. T h i s is t h e
Summa de exemplis ac similitudinibus return b y Giovanni di San
G i m i g n a n o , of t h e O r d e r of Preachers, which was written early
in t h e fourteenth century. 1 4 T h o u g h h e does n o t m e n t i o n T h o m a s
b y n a m e , it is an abbreviated version of t h e T h o m i s t m e m o r y
rules which San Gimignano quotes.
There are four things which help a man to remember well.
T h e first is that he should dispose those things which he wishes to
remember in a certain order.
T h e second is that he should adhere to them with affection.

Many such collections for the use of preachers were compiled; see

Moyen Age, Paris-Toulouse, 1927.

call h i m Saint T h o m a s is t h e evidence t h a t t h e book was written
before t h e canonisation in 1323. T h e following are Bartolomeo's
rules which I translate, t h o u g h leaving t h e sources in t h e original
Italian:
(On order).
Aristotile in libro memoria. Those things are better remembered
which have order in themselves. Upon which Thomas comments:
Those things are more easily remembered which are well ordered,
and those which are badly ordered we do not easily remember.
Therefore those things which a man wishes to retain, let him study
to set them in order.
Tommaso nella seconda della seconda. It is necessary that those
things which a man wishes to retain in memory he should consider
how to set out in order, so that from the memory of one thing he
comes to another.
(On similitudes).
Tommaso nella seconda della seconda. Of those things which a man
wishes to remember, he should take convenient similitudes, not too
common ones, for we wonder more at uncommon things and by
them the mind is more strongly moved.
Tommaso quivi medesimo (i.e. loc. cit.). T h e finding out of images is
useful and necessary for memory; for pure and spiritual intentions
slip out of memory unless they are as it were linked to corporeal
similitudes.
Tullio nel terzo della nuova Rettorica. Of those things which we wish
to remember, we should place in certain places images and simili-tudes. And Tullius adds that the places are like tablets, or paper,
and the images like letters, and placing the images is like writing,
and speaking is like reading. 18
Obviously, Bartolomeo is fully aware t h a t T h o m a s ' s recommenda-tion of order in m e m o r y is based o n Aristotle, a n d that his recom-m e n d a t i o n of t h e use of similitudes a n d images is based o n Ad

Herennium, refered to as 'Tullius in t h e t h i r d book of t h e N e w
Rhetoric'.
W h a t are we, as devout readers of Bartolomeo's ethical work
i n t e n d e d to do ? I t has been arranged in order with divisions a n d
sub-divisions after t h e scholastic m a n n e r . O u g h t w e n o t to act
p r u d e n t l y b y memorising in their order t h r o u g h t h e artificial
m e m o r y t h e 'things' with which it deals, t h e spiritual intentions of
seeking virtues a n d avoiding vices which it arouses ? Should we not
exercise our imaginations b y forming corporeal similitudes of,
for example, Justice a n d its sub-divisions, or of P r u d e n c e a n d her
parts ? A n d also of t h e ' t h i n g s ' to b e avoided, such as Injustice,
Inconstancy, a n d t h e other vices examined ? T h e task will not b e an
easy one, for we live in n e w times w h e n t h e old virtue-vice system
has been complicated b y t h e discovery of new teachings of the
ancients. Yet surely it is our d u t y to r e m e m b e r these teachings b y
t h e ancient art of m e m o r y . P e r h a p s w e shall also m o r e easily
r e m e m b e r t h e m a n y quotations from ancients a n d Fathers by
memorising these as written o n or near t h e corporeal similitudes
which we are forming in m e m o r y .
T h a t Bartolomeo's collection of moral teachings of t h e ancients
was regarded as eminently suitable for memorisation is confirmed
b y t h e fact that in two fifteenth-century codices 1 9 his work is
associated with a ' T r a t t a t o della m e m o r i a artificiale'. T h i s treatise
passed into t h e p r i n t e d editions of t h e Ammaestramenti
degli
antichi in which it was assumed to b e b y Bartolomeo himself. 2 0
T h i s was an error for t h e "Trattato della memoria artificiale' is not
an original work b u t an Italian translation of t h e m e m o r y section
of Ad Herennium which has b e e n detached from t h e Italian transla-tion of t h e rhetoric m a d e , probably b y Bono Giamboni, in the
thirteenth century. 2 1 I n this translation, k n o w n as t h e Fiore di
Rettorica, t h e m e m o r y section was placed at t h e e n d of t h e work,
19
J.I. 47 and Pal. 54, both in the Bibliotheca Nazionale at Florence.
Cf. Rossi, Clavis universalis, pp. 16–17, 271–5.
20
The first to print the 'Trattato della memoria artificiale' with the
Ammaestramenti was Manni in his edition of 1734. Subsequent editors
followed his error of assuming that the 'Trattato' is by Bartolomeo; it was
printed after, the Ammaestramenti in all later editions (in the edition of
Milan, 1808, it is on pp. 343–56).
21
The two rhetorics (De inventione and Ad Herennium) were amongst
the earliest classical works to be translated into Italian. A free translation
of the parts of the first Rhetoric (De inventione) was made by Dante's
88

MEDIAEVAL MEMORY AND THE FORMATION OF IMAGERY
a n d so was easily detachable. Possibly it was so placed t h r o u g h t h e
influence of Boncompagno, who stated that m e m o r y did not belong
to rhetoric alone b u t was useful for all subjects. 2 2 By placing the
m e m o r y section at t h e e n d of t h e Italian translation of t h e rhetoric
it became easily detachable, a n d applicable to other subjects, for
example to ethics and t h e memorising of virtues and vices. T h e
detached m e m o r y section of Ad Herennium in Giamboni's transla-tion, circulating b y itself, 23 is an ancestor of t h e separate Ars
memorativa treatise.
A remarkable feature of t h e Ammaestramenti degli antichi, in view
of its early date, is that it is in t h e vulgar tongue. W h y did t h e
learned Dominican present his semi-scholastic treatise o n ethics in
Italian ? Surely t h e reason m u s t b e that h e was addressing himself
to laymen, to devout persons ignorant of L a t i n w h o wanted to
know about t h e moral teachings of t h e ancients, and not primarily
to clerics. W i t h this work in t h e volgare became associated Tullius
on m e m o r y , also translated into t h e volgare.24 T h i s suggests t h a t
t h e artificial m e m o r y was coming out into t h e world, was being
r e c o m m e n d e d to laymen as a devotional exercise. A n d this tallies
22
This is my suggestion. It is however recognised that there is an
influence of the Bolognese school of dictamen on the early translations of
the rhetorics; see Maggini, Op. cit.y p. I.
23
It is to be found by itself in the fifteenth-century Vatican manuscript
Barb. Lat. 3929, f. 52, where a modern note wrongly attributes it to
Brunetto Latini.
There is much confusion about Brunetto Latini and the translations of
the rhetorics. The facts are that he made a free version of De inventione
but did not translate Ad Herennium. But he certainly knew of the artificial
memory to which he refers in the third book of the Trésor: 'memore
artificiel que l'en aquiert par ensegnement des sages' (B. Latini, Li Livres
dou Tresor, ed. F. J. Carmody, Berkeley, 1948, p. 321).
24
This association is only found in two codices which are both of the
fifteenth century. The earliest manuscript of the Ammaestramenti Bibl.
Naz., II. II. 319, dated 1342) does not contain the 'Trattato'.

teacher, Brunetto Latini. A version of the Second Rhetoric (Ad Heren-nium) was made between 1254 and 1266 by Guidotto of Bologna, with the
title Fiore di Rettorica. This version omits the section on memory. But
another translation, also called Fiore di Rettorica, was made at about the
same time by Bono Giamboni, and this does contain the memory section,
placed at the end of the work.
On the Italian translations of the two rhetorics, see F. Maggini,
I primi volgarizzamenti dei classici latini, Florence, 1952.

with t h e remark of Albertus, w h e n h e is concluding t r i u m p h a n t l y
in favour of t h e Ars memorandi of T u l l i u s , t h a t t h e artificial m e m o r y
pertains b o t h 'to t h e moral m a n a n d to t h e speaker'. 2 5 N o t only

which lead to Hell a n d to reach Heaven t h r o u g h t h e virtues.
Another ethical treatise which was certainly intended to b e
memorised b y t h e artificial m e m o r y is also in Italian. T h i s is t h e
Rosaio della vita,26 probably b y M a t t e o d e ' Corsini and written in
1373. I t opens with some rather curious mystico-astrological
features b u t consists mainly of long lists of virtues a n d vices, with
short definitions. I t is a mixed collection of such 'things' from
Aristotelian, T u l l i a n , patristic, Scriptural, a n d other sources. I
select a few at r a n d o m — W i s d o m , P r u d e n c e , Knowledge, Credu-lity, F r i e n d s h i p , Litigation, W a r , Peace, P r i d e , Vain Glory. A n
Ars memorie artificialis is provided to b e used with it, opening with
t h e words ' N o w that we have provided t h e book to b e read it
remains to hold it in m e m o r y . ' 2 7 T h e book provided is certainly
t h e Rosaio della vita which is later mentioned b y n a m e in t h e text
of t h e m e m o r y rules, a n d we t h u s have certain proof t h a t t h e
m e m o r y rules were here intended to b e used for memorising lists
of virtues a n d vices.
T h e Ars memorie artificialis provided for memorising the virtues
and vices of t h e Rosaio is closely based on Ad Herennium b u t with
expansions. T h e writer calls 'natural places' those which are
memorised in t h e country, as trees in fields; 'artificial places' are
those memorised in buildings, as a study, a window, a coffer, and
t h e like. 2 8 T h i s shows some real understanding of places as used
in t h e mnemotechnic. B u t t h e technique would b e being used with
t h e moral a n d devotional p u r p o s e of memorising corporeal simili-tudes of virtues a n d vices o n t h e places.
T h e r e is probably some connection between t h e Rosaio a n d the
Ammaestramenti
degli antichi; t h e former might almost b e an

early fourteenth-century works of art from t h e point of view of
memory. See for example t h e row of virtuous figures (P1. 2) in
Lorenzetti's presentation of G o o d a n d Bad G o v e r n m e n t (com-missioned between 1337 a n d 1340) in t h e Palazzo C o m m u n a l e
at Siena. 3 0 O n t h e left sits Justice, with secondary figures
illustrating her ' p a r t s ' , after the m a n n e r of a composite memory,
image. O n t h e couch, to t h e right, sits Peace (and F o r t i t u d e ,
P r u d e n c e , Magnanimity, T e m p e r a n c e , n o t here reproduced).
O n t h e b a d side of t h e series (not here reproduced), with t h e
diabolical h o r n e d figure of T y r a n n y , sit t h e hideous forms
of tyrannical vices, whilst W a r , Avarice, Pride, a n d Vain Glory
hover like bats over t h e grotesque a n d dreadful crew.
Such images, of course, have most complex derivations, and
such a picture can b e studied in m a n y ways, b y iconographers,
historians, art historians. I would tentatively suggest yet another
approach. T h e r e is an a r g u m e n t b e h i n d this picture about Justice
a n d Injustice, t h e themes of which are set out in order and clothed
in corporeal similitudes. Does it n o t gain in meaning after our
attempts to imagine the efforts of T h o m i s t artificial m e m o r y to
form corporeal similitudes for t h e moral 'teachings of t h e ancients' ?
C a n we see in these great m o n u m e n t a l figures a striving to regain
t h e forms of classical m e m o r y , of those imagines
agentes—remark-ably beautiful, crowned, richly dressed, or remarkably hideous a n d
grotesque—moralised b y t h e M i d d l e Ages into virtues and vices,
into similitudes expressive of spiritual intentions ?
W i t h yet greater daring, I n o w invite t h e reader to look with t h e
eyes of m e m o r y at those figures sacred to art historians, Giotto's
virtues and vices (probably painted about 1306) in t h e Arena Capella
at P a d u a (P1. 3). T h e s e figures are justly famous for t h e variety
and animation introduced into t h e m b y t h e great artist, and for t h e
way in which they stand out from their backgrounds, giving an
illusion of d e p t h o n a flat surface which was altogether new. I
would suggest t h a t b o t h features m a y owe something to m e m o r y .
T h e effort to form similitudes in m e m o r y encouraged variety
a n d individual invention, for did n o t T u l l i u s say t h a t everyone
m u s t form his m e m o r y images for himself? I n a renewed r e t u r n to
t h e text of Ad Herennium aroused b y t h e scholastic insistence on

artificial m e m o r y , t h e dramatic character of t h e images recom-m e n d e d would appeal to an artist of genius, a n d this is what Giotto
shows so brilliantly in, for example, t h e m o v e m e n t of Charity
(P1. 3a), with her attractive beauty, or in t h e frenzied gestures of
Inconstancy. N o r has t h e grotesque a n d t h e a b s u r d as useful in a
m e m o r y image been neglected in E n v y (P1. 3b) a n d Folly. A n d t h e
illusion of d e p t h depends on t h e intense care with which the images
have been placed on their backgrounds, or, speaking mnemonically,
o n their loci. O n e of t h e most striking features of classical memo-ries as revealed in Ad Herennium is t h e sense of space, d e p t h ,
lighting in t h e m e m o r y suggested by t h e place r u l e s ; a n d t h e care
taken to make t h e images stand out clearly o n t h e loci, for example
in t h e injunction t h a t places m u s t not b e too dark, or t h e images
will b e obscured, nor too light lest t h e dazzle confuse t h e images. I t
is t r u e that Giotto's images are regularly placed on t h e walls, n o t
irregularly as t h e classical directions advise. But t h e T h o m i s t
emphasis on regular order in m e m o r y h a d modified that rule. A n d
Giotto has interpreted the advice about variety in loci in his own
way, b y making all t h e painted backgrounds of t h e pictures
different from one another. H e has, I would suggest, m a d e a
supreme effort to make the images stand out against t h e carefully
variegated loci, believing that in so doing h e is following classical
advice for making memorable images.
WE MUST ASSIDUOUSLY REMEMBER THE INVISIBLE JOYS OF PARADISE
AND THE ETERNAL TORMENTS OF HELL, Says BonCOmpagno with
terrible emphasis in t h e m e m o r y section of his rhetoric, giving
lists of virtues a n d vices as 'memorial notes . . . t h r o u g h which we
may frequently direct ourselves in t h e paths of r e m e m b r a n c e ' . 3 1
T h e side walls of t h e Arena Capella o n w h i c h t h e virtues a n d vices
are painted frame t h e Last J u d g m e n t on t h e e n d wall which
dominates t h e little building. I n t h e intense atmosphere aroused
b y t h e friars a n d their preaching, in which Giotto was saturated,
t h e images of t h e virtues a n d vices take on an intense significance,
a n d to r e m e m b e r t h e m , a n d to take warning b y t h e m in time, is a
matter of life a n d death importance. H e n c e t h e need to make truly
memorable images of t h e m in accordance with t h e rules of artificial
memory. O r rather, t h e need to make truly memorable corporeal
similitudes of t h e m infused with spiritual intentions, in accordance

MEDIAEVAL MEMORY AND THE FORMATION OF IMAGERY
how to use 'moving' inner m e m o r y images of t h e gods to memorise
a sermon on t h e virtues a n d their parts. Each image, like t h e one of
Idolatry, has attributes and characteristics, carefully described
and memorised in a m n e m o n i c verse, which serve to illustrate—or
rather, as I think, to memorise—points in a discourse on t h e virtue
concerned.
Holcot's Moralitates are a collection of material for t h e use of
preachers in which t h e 'picture' technique is lavishly used.
Efforts to find t h e sources of these 'pictures' have failed, a n d n o
wonder, for it is clear that, as in t h e case of Ridevall's similar
efforts, they are invented m e m o r y images. Holcot often gives t h e m
what Miss Smalley calls a ' s h a m antique' flavour, as in the 'picture'
of Penance.
T h e likeness of Penance, which the priests of the goddess Vesta
painted, according to Remigius. Penance used to be painted in the
form of a man, his whole body naked, who held a five-thonged
scourge in his hand. Five verses or sentences were written on it. 41
T h e inscriptions about Penance on the five-thonged scourge are
t h e n given, a n d this use of inscriptions on, and surrounding, his
images is characteristic of Holcot's m e t h o d . T h e 'picture' of
Friendship, for example, a youth strikingly attired in green, has
inscriptions about Friendship on it and a r o u n d it. 4 2
N o n e of t h e n u m e r o u s manuscripts of t h e Moralitates
are
illustrated; t h e 'pictures' which they describe were not m e a n t for
external representation; they were invisible m e m o r y images.
However, Saxl did find some representations of Holcot's images in
two fifteenth-century manuscripts, including a representation of
his 'Penance' (Pl. 4 c ) . 4 3 W h e n we see t h e m a n with the scourge
with t h e inscriptions on it, we recognise t h e technique of an image
with writing on it as something fairly n o r m a l in mediaeval manu-scripts. But the point is t h a t we ought n o t to b e seeing this image
represented. I t was an invisible m e m o r y image. A n d this suggests
to m e that t h e memorising of words or sentences as placed or
written on the m e m o r y images was perhaps what the M i d d l e Ages
understood b y ' m e m o r y for words'.

MEDIAEVAL MEMORY AND THE FORMATION OF IMAGERY
n a m e is continually repeated in sixteenth-century m e m o r y
treatises. Gesualdo speaks of 'Petrarch w h o m R o m b e r c h follows
on m e m o r y ' . 5 1 Garzoni includes Petrarch a m o n g t h e famous
'Professors of M e m o r y ' . 5 2 H e n r y Cornelius Agrippa after giving
t h e classical sources for t h e art of m e m o r y , mentions as t h e first
of t h e m o d e r n authorities, Petrarch. 5 3 I n t h e early seventeenth
century, L a m b e r t Schenkel states that t h e art of m e m o r y was
'avidly revived' and 'diligently cultivated' b y Petrarch. 5 4 A n d t h e
n a m e of Petrarch is even mentioned in t h e article on M e m o r y in
Diderot's Encyclopaedia. 5 5
T h e r e m u s t therefore have been a side of Petrarch for which h e
was admired in t h e ages of m e m o r y b u t which has been totally
forgotten b y m o d e r n Petrarchan scholars—a situation parallel to
t h e m o d e r n neglect of T h o m a s on memory. W h a t was t h e source
in Petrarch's works which gave rise to this tenacious tradition ? I t
is, of course, possible that Petrarch wrote some AYS memorativa
treatise which has n o t come d o w n to u s . I t is not, however,
necessary to suppose this. T h e source is to b e found in one of
Petrarch's extant works which we have n o t read, understood, a n d
memorised as we ought to have done.
Petrarch wrote a book called ' T h i n g s to b e R e m e m b e r e d '
(Rerum memorandarutn libri) probably about 1343 to 1345. T h i s
title is suggestive, a n d w h e n it transpires that t h e chief of t h e
'things' to b e r e m e m b e r e d is t h e virtue of P r u d e n c e u n d e r h e r
three parts of memoria, intelligentia, providentia, t h e s t u d e n t of
artificial m e m o r y knows t h a t h e is on familiar ground. T h e plan
of t h e work, only a fraction of which was executed, is based on t h e
definitions in Cicero's De inventione of P r u d e n c e , Justice, Forti-t u d e , and T e m p e r a n c e . 5 6 It opens with 'preludes to virtue', which
are leisure, solitude, study, and doctrine. T h e n comes P r u d e n c e
a n d her parts, beginning with memoria. T h e sections on Justice and
F o r t i t u d e are missing, or were never w r i t t e n ; of t h e section on

Greek. A possible source for t h e deviations from t h e m a i n medi-aeval tradition of t h e Democritus type of treatise—I p u t this
forward only as a hypothesis—might b e t h e influx of Byzantine
influence in t h e fifteenth century. T h e artificial m e m o r y was
certainly k n o w n in Byzantium, 4 where it might have been in touch
with Greek traditions lost in t h e West. Whatever its sources m a y
be, t h e teachings of t h e 'Democritus' type of treatise become
merged w i t h other types in t h e general agglomeration of t h e
m e m o r y tradition.
A feature of earlier treatises is long lists of objects, often begin-ning with a 'paternoster' a n d followed b y familiar objects, such as
an anvil, a helmet, a lantern, a tripod, and so on. O n e such list is
given b y Lodovico da Pirano and they are to b e found in t h e t y p e of
treatise with t h e incipit 'Ars memorie artificialis, pater reuerende'
of which there are m a n y copies. 5 T h e reverend father addressed is
advised to use such objects in t h e artificial m e m o r y . T h e y are, I
believe, as it were prefabricated m e m o r y images to b e memorised
on sets of places. T h i s is almost certainly an old mediaeval tradition
for similar miscellanies of objects, said to b e useful in m e m o r y , are
given b y Boncompagno in t h e thirteenth century. 6 O n e can see such
images in action in t h e illustrations to R o m b e r c h ' s book, showing
an abbey a n d its associated buildings (P1. 5a) a n d sets of objects
to b e memorised in t h e courtyard, library, a n d chapel of t h e abbey
4

A Greek translation of the memory section of Ad Herennium exists,
made perhaps by Maximus Planudes (early fourteenth century) or by
Theodore of Gaza (fifteenth century). See H. Caplan's introduction to the
Loeb edition of Ad Herennium, p. xxvi.

Place and image rules from a 'pater reuerende' treatise are quoted by
Rossi, Clavisy pp. 22–3. The image rules emphasise that images must be
like people we know. Rossi does not quote the lists of memory objects, a
typical example of which is, however, to be found in Pirano's treatise,
printed by Ziliotto in the article cited. Several other manuscripts contain-ing the 'Pater reuerende' treatise might be added to those mentioned in
Rossi's note (Clavis, p. 22).

(Pl. 5b). E a c h fifth place is m a r k e d with a h a n d a n d each t e n t h
place with a cross, in accordance with t h e instructions given in Ad
Herennium for distinguishing t h e fifth a n d t e n t h places. Obviously
there is an association here with t h e five fingers. As M e m o r y moved
along t h e places, these were ticked off o n t h e fingers.
R o m b e r c h is fully in t h e scholastic tradition in his theory of
images as 'corporeal similitudes'. T h a t h e includes in his treatise
this m o r e mechanical type of memorising, with m e m o r y objects as
images, suggests that this was in use in earlier times, a n d under-stood as artificial m e m o r y as well as t h e loftier types which used
t h e spiritualised h u m a n images. W h a t R o m b e r c h describes as
being practised in t h e abbey is a fully classical a n d mnemotechnical,
use of t h e art, t h o u g h probably mainly used for religious purposes,
possibly for memorising t h e repetition of psalms or prayers.
Amongst manuscript treatises which are in t h e scholastic
tradition, are those b y Jacopo Ragone, 7 a n d b y M a t t h e w of
Verona, 8 a Dominican. A n anonymous treatise, 9 probably also b y
a Dominican, gives a most solemn description of h o w to r e m e m b e r
t h e whole order of t h e universe a n d t h e roads to Heaven a n d Hell
b y t h e artificial m e m o r y . 1 0 Parts of this treatise are almost identical
with similar matters given b y R o m b e r c h , t h e Dominican, in his
p r i n t e d treatise. Such p r i n t e d treatises came out of a manuscript
tradition leading back into t h e M i d d l e Ages.
I t is rare for a m e m o r y treatise, either manuscript or printed, to
give an illustration of a h u m a n figure used as a m e m o r y image.

M. P. Sheridan, 'Jacopo Ragone and his Rules for Artificial Memory', in
Manuscripta (published by St. Louis University Library), i960, pp. 131 ff.
The copy of Ragone's treatise in the British Museum (Additional,

Marciana VI, 238, ff. 1 ff. 'De memoria artificiali'. This important
and interesting treatise may be earlier than the fifteenth century, the date
of this copy. The writer is emphatic that the art is to be used for devout
meditations and spiritual consolations; he will use, he says, in his art only
'devout images' and 'sacred histories' not fables or 'vana phantasmata'
(f. 1 recto ff.). He seems to regard images of saints with their attributes as
memory images to be memorised by the devout on memory loci (f. 7
verso).

THE MEMORY TREATISES
T h e Oratoriae artis epitome b y Jacobus Publicius was printed at
Venice in 1482; 1 5 t h e rhetoric has attached to it, as an appendix, an
Ars memorativa, T h i s beautiful little printed book will surely, we
may expect, take us out into a new world, t h e world of t h e revived
interest in classical rhetoric of t h e advancing Renaissance. But is
Publicius so very m o d e r n ? T h e position of his m e m o r y section at
t h e end of the rhetoric, reminds us of t h e position of t h e m e m o r y
section in t h e thirteenth-century Fiore di Rettorica, at t h e end and
detachable. A n d t h e mystical introduction to t h e Ars memorativa
is somewhat reminiscent of thirteenth-century mystical rhetorics
of the Boncompagno type.
If t h e keenness of t h e m i n d is lost, so Publicius informs us in
this introduction, t h r o u g h being enclosed within these earthly
confines, t h e following ' n e w precepts' will help towards its
release. T h e 'new precepts' are t h e rules for places a n d images.
Publicius's interpretation of these includes t h e construction of
'ficta loca', or imaginary places, which are n o n e other t h a n t h e
spheres of t h e universe—the spheres of t h e elements, planets,
fixed stars, and higher spheres—topped b y 'Paradisus', all of which
is shown on a diagram (Fig. 1). I n his rules for images which begin
' S i m p l e and spiritual intentions slip easily from t h e m e m o r y unless
joined to a corporeal similitude' h e follows T h o m a s Aquinas. H e
dwells on t h e ' A d H e r e n n i a n ' strikingness d e m a n d e d of m e m o r y
images, that they should have ridiculous movements, amazing
gestures, or b e filled with overpowering sadness or severity. 1 6
U n h a p p y E n v y as described by Ovid with h e r livid complexion,
black teeth, a n d snakey hair, is a good example of what a m e m o r y
image should be.
F a r from introducing us to a m o d e r n world of revived classical
rhetoric, Publicius's m e m o r y section seems rather to transport us
back into a D a n t e s q u e world in which Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise
are r e m e m b e r e d o n t h e spheres of t h e universe, a Giottesque
world with its sharpened expressiveness of virtue and vice m e m o r y
figures. T o use Ovid's E n v y as a moving m e m o r y image from the
poets is n o t a surprising n e w classical feature b u t belongs into
the earlier m e m o r y tradition as interpreted b y Albertus M a g n u s .
I n short, this first printed m e m o r y treatise is n o t a s y m p t o m of
the revival of t h e classical art of m e m o r y as part of t h e Renais15

THE MEMORY TREATISES
Nevertheless, t h e times are changing, t h e humanists are gaining
a better understanding of t h e civilisation of classical antiquity;
classical texts are circulating in printed editions. T h e student of
rhetoric now has m a n y m o r e texts at his disposal than those First
a n d Second Rhetorics on which t h e alliance of t h e artificial m e m o r y
w i t h P r u d e n c e h a d been built. I n 1416, Poggio Bracciolini h a d
discovered a complete text of Quintilian's Institutio oratoria which
had its editio princeps at R o m e in 1470, soon followed b y other
editions. As I have emphasised earlier, of t h e three Latin sources
for t h e classical art of m e m o r y , it is Quintilian w h o gives t h e
clearest account of t h e art as a mnemotechnic. I n Quintilian t h e
art could n o w b e studied as a lay mnemotechnic, quite divorced
from t h e associations which h a d grown u p a r o u n d t h e ' A d H e r e n nian' rules in their progress t h r o u g h t h e M i d d l e Ages. A n d t h e
way would b e open for a n enterprising person to teach t h e art of
m e m o r y in a new way, as a success technique. T h e ancients, w h o
knew everything, knew how to train t h e m e m o r y , a n d t h e m a n with
a trained m e m o r y has an advantage over others which will help
h i m get on in a competitive world. T h e r e will b e a d e m a n d for t h e
artificial m e m o r y of t h e ancients as n o w better understood. A n
enterprising person saw an opportunity here a n d seized it. His
n a m e was Peter of Ravenna.
T h e Phoenix, sive artificiosa memoria (first edition at Venice in
1491) b y Peter of Ravenna became t h e most universally k n o w n of
all t h e m e m o r y text books. I t went t h r o u g h m a n y editions in m a n y
countries, 1 9 was translated, 2 0 included in t h e popular general
knowledge hand-book by Gregor Reisch, 2 1 copied b y enthusiasts
from t h e p r i n t e d editions. 2 2 Peter was a t r e m e n d o u s self-advertiser
which helped to boost his m e t h o d s , b u t his fame as a m e m o r y
teacher was probably largely d u e to t h e fact t h a t h e b r o u g h t t h e

purely mnemotechnical side. Nevertheless there is a good deal of
unexplained confusion a n d curious detail in Peter's mnemonics,
indicating that h e is n o t altogether detached from t h e mediaeval
tradition. His books become absorbed in t h e general m e m o r y
tradition as it rolls on its way. M o s t subsequent writers on m e m o r y
mention h i m , n o t excluding R o m b e r c h , t h e Dominican, w h o cites
"Petrus Ravennatis' as an authority as well as Tullius and Q u i n tilian, or T h o m a s Aquinas and Petrarch.
I do not a t t e m p t to survey here the whole tribe of the printed
m e m o r y treatises. M a n y of t h e m will b e referred to in later
chapters, as occasion arises. S o m e treatises teach what I shall here-after call ' t h e straight m n e m o t e c h n i c ' , perhaps better understood
after t h e recovery of Quintilian. I n m a n y , t h e m n e m o t e c h n i c is
closely entangled with surviving influences of t h e mediaeval
uses of the art. I n some there are traces of infiltration of mediaeval
forms of magic m e m o r y , such as t h e Ars notoria into t h e art. 2 5 I n
some there are influences from t h e Renaissance H e r m e t i c and
occult transformation of t h e art, which will b e t h e subject of most
of t h e rest of this book.
But it is i m p o r t a n t that we should look here m o r e particularly at
what m e m o r y treatises b y Dominicans were like in t h e sixteenth
century, since t h e main strand, descending from t h e scholastic
emphasis on m e m o r y , is in m y opinion t h e m o s t i m p o r t a n t strand
in t h e history of t h e subject. T h e Dominicans were naturally at t h e
centre of this tradition, and in Johannes R o m b e r c h , a G e r m a n , and
Cosmas Rosselius, a Florentine, we have two Dominicans who
wrote books on m e m o r y , small in format b u t packed with detail,
apparently intended to make t h e D o m i n i c a n art of m e m o r y
generally known. R o m b e r c h says t h a t his book will b e useful to
theologians, preachers, confessors, jurists, advocates, doctors, philo-sophers, professors of the liberal arts, and ambassadors. Rossellius
makes a similar statement. R o m b e r c h ' s book was published near
t h e beginning of t h e sixteenth c e n t u r y ; Rossellius's near its end.
T o g e t h e r they span t h e century, as influential m e m o r y teachers
w h o are frequently quoted. I n fact, Publicius, Peter of Ravenna,

Possible examples of this are Jodocus Weczdorff, Ars memorandi
nova secretissima, circa, 1600, and Nicolas Simon aus Weida, Ludus
artificialis oblivionis, Leipzig, 1510. Frontispieces and diagrams from
these heavily magical works are reproduced by Volkmann, Pis. 168–71.

R o m b e r c h is well n a m e d , for it is a strange congestion of m e m o r y
material. R o m b e r c h knows all t h e three classical sources, n o t only
Ad Herennium b u t also Cicero's De oratore a n d Quintilian. By his
frequent citation of t h e n a m e of Petrarch, 2 7 h e absorbs t h e poet
into t h e D o m i n i c a n m e m o r y tradition; Peter of Ravenna a n d others
are also d r a w n into t h e congestion. But his basis is T h o m a s Aquinas
whose formulations, b o t h in t h e Summa a n d in t h e Aristotle
commentary h e quotes on nearly every other page.
T h e book is in four p a r t s ; t h e first introductory, t h e second on
places, t h e t h i r d on images; t h e fourth part outlines an encyclo-paedic m e m o r y system.
R o m b e r c h envisages t h r e e different types of place systems, as all
belonging to artificial m e m o r y .
T h e first t y p e uses t h e cosmos as a place system, as illustrated in
his diagram (Fig. 2). H e r e w e see t h e spheres of t h e elements, of t h e
planets, of t h e fixed stars, and above t h e m t h e celestial spheres and
those of t h e n i n e orders of angels. W h a t are w e to r e m e m b e r o n
these cosmic orders ? M a r k e d on t h e lower part of t h e diagram w e
see t h e letters ' L . P A ; L . P ; PVR; I N ' T h e s e stand for t h e places of
Paradise, of t h e Earthly Paradise, of Purgatory, a n d of H e l l . 2 8 I n
R o m b e r c h ' s view, r e m e m b e r i n g places such as these belong to
artificial m e m o r y . H e calls such realms 'imaginary places' (ficta
loca). F o r t h e invisible things of Paradise w e are to form places in
m e m o r y in which w e p u t t h e choirs of angels, t h e seats of t h e
blessed, Patriarchs, P r o p h e t s , Apostles, M a r t y r s . T h e same is to b e
d o n e for Purgatory a n d Hell, which are ' c o m m o n places' or inclu-sive places, which are to b e ordered into m a n y particular places, to
b e r e m e m b e r e d in order with inscriptions on t h e m . T h e places of
Hell which contain images of sinners being p u n i s h e d in t h e m in
accordance with t h e n a t u r e of their sins, as explained in t h e
memorised inscriptions. 2 9

T h e r e are however some illustrations in this section of the book
b u t they are Visual alphabets'. Visual alphabets are ways of
representing letters of t h e alphabet b y images. T h e s e are formed in
various w a y s ; for example with pictures of objects whose shape
resemble letters of t h e alphabet (Pl. 6b), as compasses or a ladder
for A ; or a hoe for N . Another way is t h r o u g h pictures of animals
or birds arranged in t h e order of t h e first letter of their names
(Pl. 6c), as A for Anser, goose, B for Bubo, owl. Visual alphabets are
very c o m m o n in t h e m e m o r y treatises a n d they almost certainly
come out of an old tradition. Boncompagno speaks of a n 'imaginary
alphabet' which is to b e used for r e m e m b e r i n g n a m e s . 3 5 Such

ones a n d t h e ' b i r d s ' one which h e is using in combination. H e
explains that h e is memorising in this way t h e answer to t h e ques-tion as to whether G r a m m a r is a c o m m o n or a particular science;
t h e reply involves t h e use of t h e terms predicatio, application,
continentia.40 Predicatio is memorised b y t h e bird beginning with a
P (a Pica or pie) which she holds, a n d its associated objects from
t h e object alphabet. Applicatio is r e m e m b e r e d by t h e Aquila41 and
associated objects on her a r m . Continentia is r e m e m b e r e d b y t h e
inscription on her chest in t h e 'objects' alphabet (see t h e objects
representing C , O , N , T , in t h e 'objects' alphabet, Pl. 6b).
T h o u g h devoid of aesthetic charm, R o m b e r c h ' s G r a m m a r is of
importance to t h e student of artificial m e m o r y . She proves t h e
point t h a t personifications, such as t h e familiar figures of t h e
liberal arts, w h e n reflected in m e m o r y , become m e m o r y images.
A n d that inscriptions are to b e m a d e in m e m o r y on such figures for
memorising material about t h e subject of t h e personification. T h e
principle exemplified in R o m b e r c h ' s G r a m m a r could b e applied to
all other personifications, such as those of t h e virtues and vices,
w h e n used as m e m o r y images. T h i s is w h a t we suspected in t h e
last chapter w h e n we realised that t h e inscriptions about Penance
o n t h e scourge of Holcot's m e m o r y image of Penance were probably
' m e m o r y for words'. A n d w h e n we t h o u g h t that t h e inscriptions
recording t h e parts of t h e cardinal virtues, as defined in the Summa
of T h o m a s Aquinas, on t h e images of these virtues, were perhaps
also ' m e m o r y for words'. T h e images themselves recall t h e m e m o r y
of t h e 'things' a n d t h e inscriptions memorised on t h e m are
' m e m o r y for w o r d s ' about t h e 'things'. O r so I would suggest.
R o m b e r c h ' s G r a m m a r , here u n d o u b t e d l y being used as a
m e m o r y image, shows t h e m e t h o d in action, with t h e added
refinement that t h e inscriptions are m a d e (so it is supposed) m o r e
memorable b y being m a d e n o t in ordinary writing, b u t in images
for t h e letters from visual alphabets.
T h e discussion about h o w to memorise G r a m m a r , h e r parts a n d
arguments about her, comes in t h e last part of R o m b e r c h ' s book in
which h e outlines an extremely ambitious p r o g r a m m e for com-mitting all t h e sciences, theological, metaphysical, moral, as well as

to T h e o l o g y . 4 2 R o m b e r c h t h e n proceeds to set out in columns t h e
parts a n d subdivisions of Theology, Metaphysics (including
philosophy and moral philosophy), L a w , Astronomy, Geometry,
Arithmetic, M u s i c , Logic, Rhetoric, a n d G r a m m a r . F o r t h e
memorisation of all of these subjects, images are to b e formed with
associated images a n d inscriptions. Each subject is to b e placed in a

complicated, a n d t h e memorising of most abstract metaphysical
themes, and even of logical arguments, is envisaged. O n e has t h e

order in R o m b e r c h ' s book, t h e possibility arises t h a t we m a y have
in this late D o m i n i c a n m e m o r y treatise some distant echo of t h e
m e m o r y system of T h o m a s Aquinas himself.
Looking back at t h e fresco in t h e Chapter H o u s e of Santa M a r i a
Novella, our eye rests once m o r e o n t h e fourteen corporeal
similitudes, seven of t h e liberal arts and seven other figures added
to represent T h o m a s ' s knowledge of m u c h loftier spheres of
learning. After our study of t h e m e m o r y system in R o m b e r c h , in
which m e m o r y figures are formed for t h e highest sciences, as well
as for t h e liberal arts, in some stupendous attempt to hold a vast
s u m m a of knowledge in m e m o r y t h r o u g h series of images, w e m a y
wonder whether it is n o t something of this kind which is repre-sented b y t h e figures of t h e fresco. T h e guess m a d e o n an earlier
page of this book that those figures m a y n o t only symbolise t h e
extent of T h o m a s ' s learning b u t may also allude to his m e t h o d of
memorising it b y t h e art of m e m o r y , as h e understands it, m a y n o w

A severe blow to t h e art of m e m o r y as understood in t h e M i d d l e
Ages was dealt b y m o d e r n humanist philological scholarship. I n
1491, Raphael Regius b r o u g h t t h e new critical techniques to bear
on Ad Herennium and suggested Cornificius as t h e author. 5 0
Shortly before, Lorenzo Valla h a d taken u p this question, p u t t i n g
t h e whole weight of his great reputation as a philological scholar
against t h e attribution of this work to Cicero. 5 1 T h e w r o n g
attribution lingered for a time in t h e printed editions, 5 2 b u t gradu-ally it became generally k n o w n that Ad Herennium is not by Cicero.
T h i s broke u p t h e old alliance between t h e First a n d Second
Rhetorics of Tullius. I t remained t r u e that Tullius was really t h e
author of De inventione, t h e First Rhetoric, w h e r e h e h a d really
said t h a t m e m o r y is a part of P r u d e n c e ; b u t t h e neat sequel, t h a t
Tullius teaches in t h e Second Rhetoric that m e m o r y can b e trained
b y t h e artificial m e m o r y d r o p p e d off, since Tullius was n o t t h e
author of t h e Second Rhetoric. T h e importance for t h e m e m o r y
tradition descending from t h e M i d d l e Ages of t h e wrong attribu-tion is shown b y t h e fact that t h e discovery of t h e h u m a n i s t
philologists is consistently ignored b y writers in that tradition.
R o m b e r c h always attributes his quotations from Ad Herennium to
Cicero 5 3 so does Rossellius. 5 4 N o t h i n g shows m o r e clearly that
Giordano B r u n o came out of t h e D o m i n i c a n m e m o r y tradition
t h a n t h e fact that this ex-friar, in a work on m e m o r y published in
1582, firmly ignores h u m a n i s t critical scholarship b y introducing a
quotation from Ad Herennium with t h e words, ' H e a r what Tullius
says'. 5 5

some purposes, on t h e whole r e c o m m e n d s m o r e straightforward
m e t h o d s of memorising.
Though I do not deny that memory can be helped by places and
images, yet the best memory is based on three most important
things, namely study, order, and care. 57
T h e quotation is from E r a s m u s ; b u t behind t h e words of t h e great
critical scholar w e can hear those of Quintilian. T h e distinctly cool
a n d Quintilianist attitude of E r a s m u s t o t h e artificial m e m o r y
develops in later leading h u m a n i s t educators into a strong disap-proval of it. M e l a n c h t h o n forbids students to use any m n e m o t e c h nical devices a n d enjoins learning b y heart in t h e normal way as t h e
sole art of m e m o r y . 5 8
W e have to r e m e m b e r that for E r a s m u s , confidently emerging
into a brave n e w world of m o d e r n h u m a n i s t scholarship, t h e art of
m e m o r y would wear a mediaeval look. I t belonged to t h e ages of
b a r b a r i s m ; its m e t h o d s in decay were an example of those cobwebs
in monkish m i n d s w h i c h n e w brooms m u s t sweep away. E r a s m u s
did n o t like t h e M i d d l e Ages, a dislike which developed into
violent antagonism in t h e Reformation, a n d t h e art of m e m o r y was
a mediaeval a n d a scholastic art.
T h u s , in t h e sixteenth century, t h e art of m e m o r y might appear
to b e o n t h e wane. T h e p r i n t e d book is destroying age-old m e m o r y
habits. T h e mediaeval transformation of t h e art, t h o u g h still living

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

discourse on any subject no less fluently than Cicero. I thought at
first that this was a fable until I learned of the thing more fully
from Baptista Egnatio. It is said that this Architect has drawn up
in certain places whatever about anything is found in Cicero . . .
Certain orders or grades offiguresare disposed... with stupendous
labour and divine skill.'6 Camillo is said to be making a copy of this
splendid invention which he destines for the King of France, to
whom he recently offered it and who has givenfivehundred ducats
towards its completion.
When next Viglius writes to Erasmus he has been to Venice and
has met Camillo who has allowed him to see the Theatre (it was a
theatre, not an amphitheatre, as will appear later). 'Now you must
know', he writes, 'that Viglius has been in the Amphitheatre and
has diligently inspected everything.' The object was thus clearly
more than a small model; it was a building large enough to be
entered by at least two people at once; Viglius and Camillo were
in it together.
The work is of wood [continues Viglius], marked with many
images, and full of little boxes; there are various orders and grades
in it. He gives a place to each individualfigureand ornament, and
he showed me such a mass of papers that, though I always heard
that Cicero was the fountain of richest eloquence, scarcely would I
have thought that one author could contain so much or that so
many volumes could be pieced together out of his writings. I wrote
to you before the name of the author who is called Julius Camillus.
He stammers badly and speaks Latin with difficulty, excusing
himself with the pretext that through continually using his pen he
has nearly lost the use of speech. He is said however to be good in
the vernacular which he has taught at some time at Bologna.
When I asked him concerning the meaning of the work, its plan
and results—speaking religiously and as though stupefied by the
miraculousness of the thing—he threw before me some papers,
and recited them so that he expressed the numbers, clauses, and all
the artifices of the Italian style, yet slighdy unevenly because of
the impediment in his speech. The King is said to be urging that he
should return to France with the magnificent work. But since the
King wished that all the writing should be translated into French,
for which he had tried an interpreter and scribe, he said that he
thought that he would defer his journey rather than exhibit an
6

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

imperfect work. He calls this theatre of his by many names, saying
now that it is a built or constructed mind and soul, and now that it
is a windowed one. He pretends that all things that the human
mind can conceive and which we cannot see with the corporeal
eye, after being collected together by diligent meditation may be
expressed by certain corporeal signs in such a way that the beholder
may at once perceive with his eyes everything that is otherwise
hidden in the depths of the human mind. And it is because of this
corporeal looking that he calls it a theatre.
When I asked him whether he had written anything in defence
of his opinion, since there are many to-day who do not approve of
this zeal in imitating Cicero, he replied that he had written much
but had as yet published little save a few small things in Italian
dedicated to the King. He has in mind to publish his views on the
matter when he can have quiet, and the work is perfected to which
he is giving all his energies. He says that he has already spent
1,500 ducats on it, though the King has so far only given 500.
But he expects ample reward from the King when he has experi-enced the fruits of the work.7
Poor Camillo! His Theatre was never fully perfected; his great
work was never written. Even under normal circumstances, this is a
condition which gives rise to much anxiety. How heavy must the
burden be when one is a divine man of whom divine things are
expected! And when the final secret of the work is magical,
mystical, belonging to the occult philosophy, impossible to explain
to a rational enquirer, like this friend of Erasmus, under whose eye
the Idea of the Memory Theatre dissolves into stammering
incoherence.
For Erasmus, the classical art of memory was a rational mnemotechnic, possibly useful in moderation but to which more ordinary
methods of memorising were to be preferred. And he was strongly
against all magical short cuts to memory. What will he think of this
Hermetic memory system ? Viglius is well aware of what the atti-tude of his learned friend will be to Camillo's Theatre, and he
apologises at the beginning of the letter for offending his serious ear
with trifles.
Camillo returned to France at some time after the interview at
Venice described by Viglius. The exact dates of his journeys to

France are not fixed8 but he was certainly in Paris in 1534 when
Jacques Bording, in a letter to Etienne Dolet, says that he has
recently arrived there to instruct the King, adding that, 'He is
constructing here an amphitheatre for the King, for the purpose
of marking out divisions of memory.' 9 In a letter of 1558, Gilbert
Cousin says that he has seen Camillo's Theatre, a structure made of
wood, at the French court. Cousin is writing more than ten years
after Camillo's death and his description of the Theatre is copied
from the letters of Viglius, then unpublished but to which he could
have had access as Erasmus' secretary. 10 This rather diminishes
the value of Cousin's letter as a first hand account of what he saw
in France, but it is probable that the Theatre constructed in
France closely followed the model which Viglius saw in Venice.
The French version of the Theatre seems to have disappeared
early. In the seventeenth century, the great French antiquary
Montfaucon made enquiries about it but could find no trace of it. 11
Camillo and his Theatre were as much talked of at the French
court as they were in Italy, and various legends about his stay in
France are extant. The most intriguing of these is the lion story,
one version of which is told by Betussi in his dialogues published
in 1544. He says that one day in Paris Giulio Camillo went to see
some wild animals, together with the Cardinal of Lorraine, Luigi
Alamanni, and other gentlemen, including Betussi himself. A lion
escaped and came towards the party.
The gentlemen were much alarmed and fled hither and thither,
except Messer Giulio Camillo who remained where he was, without
moving. This he did, not in order to give proof of himself, but
because of the weight of his body which made him slower in his
movements than the others. The king of animals began to walk
round him and to caress him, without otherwise molesting him,
until it was chased back to its place. What will you say to this ?
Why was he not killed ? It was thought by all that he remained
safe and sound because he was under the planet of the sun.12

The lion story is repeated with complacency by Camillo himself13
as proof of his possession of 'solar virtue', though he does not
mention the reason why, according to Betussi, he did not run away
as fast as the others. The behaviour of the solar animal in the pres-ence of the Magus whose Hermetic memory system, as we shall see
later, was centred on the sun was evidently a valuable asset for his
publicity.
According to Camillo's friend and disciple, Girolamo Muzio, the
great man was back in Italy in 1543.14 It would seem from a hint
in a letter of Erasmus to Viglius that the ducats did not flow as
liberally from the French King as he had hoped.15 At any rate, on
his return to Italy Camillo appears to have been out of a job, or
rather out of a patron. The Marchese del Vasto (Alfonso Davalos,
the Spanish governor of Milan who had been the patron of
Ariosto) enquired of Muzio whether anything had come of Camil-lo's hopes of the King of France. If not, he would give him a
pension in return for being taught 'the secret'.16 This offer was
accepted, and Camillo spent what remained of his life as Del
Vasto's pensioner, discoursing in his presence and in various
Academies. He died at Milan in 1544.
In 1559 a little guide book to the villas near Milan and the
collections of their wealthy owners was published. Here we read
that a most virtuous gentleman of the name of Pomponio Cotta
sometimes escapes from noisome imprisonment in Milan (in other
words from the pressure of city life) to the solitudes of his villa,
there to flee the society of others in order to find himself. Here he
employs himself now in hunting, now in reading books on agricul-ture, now in having imprese painted, with mottoes full of subtlety
which give proof of his remarkable intelligence.
And amongst the marvellous pictures ('pitture') which are there,
may be seen the lofty and incomparable fabric of the marvellous
Theatre of the most excellent Giulio Camillo'17

published in 1550, and so cannot be relied upon as a description
of what was actually in the villa. Had the owner of the villa picked
up the Theatre itself, or one of the versions of it, to add to his
collection of rarities ? Tiraboschi thought that the 'pitture' were
frescoes painted from themes in the imagery of the Theatre,18 but
Tiraboschi did not believe that the Theatre had ever really
existed as an object, as we know that it did. But his interpretation
of the 'pitture' may be correct, since it is stated in the preface to
the Idea del Theatro that 'the entire machine of so superb an
edifice cannot now be found',19 which sounds as though the
Theatre as an object could not be traced in Italy by 1550.
In spite of, or perhaps even because of, the fragmentary nature
of his achievement, the fame of Giulio Camillo suffered no
diminution at his death, but on the contrary glowed more brightly
than ever. In 1552 Ludovico Dolce, a popular writer with a keen
sense of what would interest the public, wrote a preface for a
collected edition of Camillo's somewhat scanty works in which he
lamented the early death of this genius who, like Pico della
Mirandola, had not completed his work nor brought forth the full
fruit of his 'more divine than human intellect'.20 In 1588, Girolamo
Muzio in an oration at Bologna extolled the philosophies of Mercurius Trismegistus, Pythagoras, Plato, Pico della Mirandola, with
which he grouped the Theatre of Giulio Camillo.21 In 1578, J. M.
Toscanus published at Paris his Peplus Italiae, a series of Latin
poems on famous Italians, amongst which is one on Camillo to
whose marvellous Theatre the seven wonders of the world must
do homage. In a note to the poem Camillo is described as most
learned in the mystical traditions of the Hebrews which are called
Cabala, and profoundly versed in the philosophies of the Egypt-ians, the Pythagoreans, and the Platonists.22
In the Renaissance the 'philosophies of the Egyptians' mean

chiefly the supposed writings of Hermes, or Mercurius, Trismegistus, otherwise the Corpus Hermeticum and the Asclepius, so
deeply meditated upon by Ficino. To these Pico della Mirandola
had added the mysteries of the Jewish Cabala. It is no accident that
Camillo's name is so frequently linked by his admirers with that
of Pico della Mirandola, for he belonged fully and enthusiastically
to the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition which Pico founded.23 His great
work in life was to adapt that tradition to the classical art of memory.
When towards the end of his life Camillo was at Milan in the
service of Del Vasto, he dictated to Girolamo Muzio, on seven
mornings, an outline of his Theatre.24 After his death the manu-script passed into other hands and was published at Florence and
Venice in 1550 with the title L'Idea del Theatro dell'eccellen. M.
Giulio Camillo.25 It is this work which enables one to reconstruct
the Theatre to some extent, and on it our plan (see Folder) is based.
The Theatre rises in seven grades or steps, which are divided
by seven gangways representing the seven planets. The student of
it is to be as it were a spectator before whom are placed the seven
measures of the world 'in spettaculo', or in a theatre. And since in
ancient theatres the most distinguished persons sat in the lowest
seats, so in this Theatre the greatest and most important things
will be in the lowest place.26
We have heard some of Camillo's contemporaries describe his
work as an amphitheatre, but these indications make it quite
certain that he was thinking of the Roman theatre as described by
Vitruvius. Vitruvius says that in the auditorium of the theatre the
seats are divided by seven gangways, and he also mentions that the
upper classes sat in the lowest seats.27
Camillo's Memory Theatre is however a distortion of the plan of
the real Vitruvian theatre. On each of its seven gangways are seven

Vitruvius, De architectura, Lib. V, cap. 6. On the plan of Camillo's
Theatre, the central gangway has been made wider than the others.
Camillo does not state that this is to be so but there is a warrant in ancient
theatre design for it. L. B. Alberti in his De re aedificatoria (Lib. VIII,
cap. 7) calls the wider central gangway the 'via regia'.

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

gates or doors. These gates are decorated with many images. On
our plan, the gates are schematically represented and on them are
written English translations of the descriptions of the images. That
there would be no room for an audience to sit between these
enormous and lavishly decorated gangway gates does not matter.
For in Camillo's Theatre the normal function of the theatre is
reversed. There is no audience sitting in the seats watching a play
on the stage. The solitary 'spectator' of the Theatre stands where
the stage would be and looks towards the auditorium, gazing at the
images on the seven times seven gates on the seven rising grades.
Camillo never mentions the stage and I have therefore omitted
it on the plan. In a normal Vitruvian theatre the back of the stage,
the frons scaenae, has five decorated doors28 through which the
actors make their exits and their entrances. Camillo is transferring
the idea of the decorated door from those in the frons scaenae to
these imaginary decorated doors over the gangways in the audi-torium which would make it impossible to seat an audience. He is
using the plan of a real theatre, the Vitruvian classical theatre, but
adapting it to his mnemonic purposes. The imaginary gates are his
memory places, stocked with images.
Looking at our plan, we can see that the whole system of the
Theatre rests basically upon seven pillars, the seven pillars of
Solomon's House of Wisdom. 'Solomon in the ninth chapter of
Proverbs says that wisdom has built herself a house and has
founded it on seven pillars. By these columns, signifying most stable
eternity, we are to understand the seven Sephiroth of the supercelestial world, which are the seven measures of the fabric of the
celestial and inferior worlds, in which are contained the Ideas of all
things both in the celestial and in the inferior worlds.'29 Camillo is
speaking of the three worlds of the Cabalists, as Pico della Mirandola had expounded them; the supercelestial world of the Sephi-roth or divine emanations; the middle celestial world of the stars;
the subcelestial or elemental world. The same'measures'run through
all three worlds though their manifestations are different in each. As
Sephiroth in the supercelestial world they are here equated with the
Platonic ideas. Camillo is basing his memory system on first causes,
on the Sephiroth, on the Ideas; these are to be the 'eternal places'
of his memory.

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

Now if the ancient orators, wishing to place from day to day the
parts of the speeches which they had to recite, confided them to frail
places as frail things, it is right that we, wishing to store up eter-nally the eternal nature of all things which can be expressed in
speech . . . should assign them to eternal places. Our high labour,
therefore, has been to find an order in these seven measures, capa-cious and distinct from one another, and which will keep the mind
awake and move the memory.30
As these words show, Camillo never loses sight of the fact that his
Theatre is based on the principles of the classical art of memory.
But his memory building is to represent the order of eternal truth;
in it the universe will be remembered through organic association
of all its parts with their underlying eternal order.
Since, as Camillo explains, the highest of the universal measures,
the Sephiroth, are remote from our knowledge and only mysteri-ously touched upon by the prophets, he places, not these, but the
seven planets on the first grade of the Theatre, for the planets are
nearer to us and their images are better grasped as memory images,
being strikingly differentiated from one another. But the planet
images, and the characters of the planets, which are placed on the
first grade are to be understood, not as termini beyond which we
cannot rise, but as also representing, as they do in the minds of the
wise, the seven celestial measures above them.31 We have indicated
this idea on the plan by showing on the gates of the first or lowest
grade, the characters of the planets, their names (standing for their
images) and then the names of the Sephiroth and angels with which
Camillo associates each planet. To bring out the importance of Sol,
he varies the arrangement in this case by representing the Sun on
the first grade by the image of a pyramid, placing the image of the
planet, an Apollo, above this on the second grade.
Thus, following the custom in ancient theatres in which the most
important people sat in the lowest seats, Camillo has placed in his
lowest grade the seven essential measures on which, according to
magico-mystical theory, all things here below depend, the seven
planets. Once these have been organically grasped, imprinted on
memory with their images and characters, the mind can move from
this middle celestial world in either direction; up into the supercelestial world of the Ideas, the Sephiroth and the angels, entering

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

Solomon's Temple of Wisdom, or down into the subcelestial and
elemental world which will range itself in order on the upper
grades of the Theatre (really the lower seats) in accordance with
the astral influences.
Each of the six upper grades has a general symbolic meaning
represented by the same image on each of its seven gates. We have
shown this on the plan by giving the name of the general image
for a grade at the top of all its gates, together with the characters of
the planets, indicating to which planetary series each gate
belongs.
Thus, on the second grade, the reader will see 'The Banquet'
written at the top of all the gates (except in the case of Sol where
'The Banquet' is placed on the first grade, an inversion to dif-ferentiate the series of the Sun from the others), for this is the
image expressive of the general meaning of this grade. 'The
second grade of the Theatre will have depicted on all its gates the
same image, and this will be a banquet. Homer feigns that Ocean
made a banquet for all the gods, nor was it without lofty mys-terious meanings that this lofty poet invented this fiction.'32 The
Ocean, explains Camillo, is the waters of wisdom which were in
existence before the materia prima, and the invited gods are the
Ideas existing in the divine exemplar. Or the Homeric banquet
suggests to him St. John's Gospel, 'In the beginning was the
Word'; or the opening words of Genesis, 'In the beginning'. In
short, the second grade of the Theatre is really the first day of
creation, imaged as the banquet given by Ocean to the gods, the
emerging elements of creation, here in their simple unmixed form.
'The third grade will have depicted on each of its gates a Cave,
which we call the Homeric Cave to differentiate it from that which
Plato describes in his Republic' In the cave of the Nymphs
described in the Odyssey, nymphs were weaving and bees were
going in and out, which activities signify, says Camillo, the mix-tures of the elements to form the elementata 'and we wish that each
of the seven caves may conserve the mixtures and elementata

Dream of Scipio, trans. W. H. Stahl, Columbia, 1952, p. 218.

belonging to it in accordance with the nature of its planet.'33
The Cave grade thus represents a further stage in creation, when
the elements are mixed to form created things or elementata. This
stage is illustrated with quotation from Cabalistic commentary on
Genesis.
With the fourth grade we reach the creation of man, or rather the
interior man, his mind and soul. 'Let us now rise to the fourth
grade belonging to the interior man, the most noble of God's
creatures which He made in his own image and similitude.'34 Why
then does this grade have as the leading image to be depicted on all
its gates the Gorgon Sisters, the three sisters described by Hesiod35
who had only one eye between them ? Because Camillo adopts from
Cabalist sources the view that man has three souls. Therefore the
image of the three sisters with one eye may be used for the fourth
grade which contains 'things belonging to the interior man in
accordance with the nature of each planet'.36
On the fifth grade, the soul of man joins his body. This is signi-fied under the image of Pasiphe and the Bull which is the leading
image on the gates of this grade. 'For she (Pasiphe) being en-amoured of the Bull signifies the soul which, according to the
Platonists, falls into a state of desiring the body.'37 The soul in its
downward journey from on high, passing through all the spheres,
changes its pure igneous vehicle into an aerial vehicle through
which it is enabled to become joined to the gross corporeal form.
This junction is symbolised by the union of Pasiphe with the Bull.
Hence the image of Pasiphe on the gates of the fifth grade of the
Theatre 'will cover all the other images (on these gates) to which
will be attached volumes containing things and words belonging,
not only to the interior man, but also to the exterior man and con-cerning the parts of his body in accordance with the nature of
each planet.. .' 38 The last image on each of the gates of this grade
is to be that of a Bull alone, and these Bulls represent the different
parts of the human body and their association with the twelve
signs of the zodiac. On the plan, these Bulls, the parts of the body
33 L'Idea del Theatro, p. 29. Cf. Homer, Odyssey, X I I I , 102 ff. The
interpretation of the Cave of the Nymphs as the mixture of the elements
derives from Porphyry, De antro nympharum.

they represent and the relevant signs of the zodiac, are indicated at
the bottom of all the gates on the fifth grade.
'The sixth grade of the Theatre has on each of the gates of the
planets, the Sandals, and other ornaments, which Mercury puts on
when he goes to execute the will of the gods, as the poets feign.
Thereby the memory will be awakened to find beneath them all the
operations which man can perform naturally . . . and without any
art.'39 We have thus to imagine the Sandals and other attributes
of Mercury placed on the top of all the gates on this grade.
' T h e seventh grade is assigned to all the arts, both noble and
vile, and above each gate is Prometheus with a lighted torch.'40
The image of Prometheus who stole the sacred fire and taught men
knowledge of the gods and of all the arts and sciences thus becomes
the topmost image, at the head of the gates on the highest grade of
the Theatre. The Prometheus grade includes not only all the arts
and sciences, but also religion, and law.41
Thus Camillo's Theatre represents the universe expanding from
First Causes through the stages of creation. First is the appearance
of the simple elements from the waters on the Banquet grade; then
the mixture of the elements in the Cave; then the creation of man's
mens in the image of God on the grade of the Gorgon Sisters; then
the union of man's soul and body on the grade of Pasiphe and the
Bull; then the whole world of man's activities; his natural activities
on the grade of the Sandals of Mercury; his arts and sciences,
religion and laws on the Prometheus grade. Though there are
unorthodox elements (to be discussed later) in Camillo's system,
his grades contain obvious reminiscences of the orthodox days of
creation.
And if we go up the Theatre, by the gangways of the seven planets,
the whole creation falls into order as the development of the seven
fundamental measures. Look, for example, at the Jupiter series.
Jupiter as a planet is associated with the element of air. On the
Banquet grade in the jupiter series, the image of Juno suspended42

42
Homer, Iliad, 18 ff. This image was anciently interpreted as an
allegory of the four elements; the two weights attached to Juno's feet
being the two heavy elements, earth and water; Juno herself, air; Jupiter
the highest fiery air or ether. See F. Buffière, Les mythes d'Homère et la
pensèe grecque, Paris, 1956, p. 43.
141
40

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

means air as a simple element; under the Cave, the same image
means air as a mixed element; with the Sandals of Mercury, it
stands for the natural operations of breathing, sighing; on the
Prometheus grade it means arts using air, such as windmills.
Jupiter is a useful, benevolent planet whose influences are pacifica-tory. In the Jupiter series the image of the Three Graces means
under the Cave, useful things; with Pasiphe and the Bull, a
beneficent nature; with the Sandals of Mercury, exercising
benevolence. The changing meaning of an image on different
grades, without losing its basic theme, is a carefully thought out
characteristic of the imagery of the Theatre. On the Gorgon
Sisters grade, the elaborate image of the Stork and Caduceus
represents Jovial characteristics in their purely spiritual or mental
form, the heavenward flight of the tranquil soul . . . choice,
judgment, counsel. Joined to the body under Pasiphe and the
Bull, the Jovial personality is represented by images suggestive of
goodness, friendliness, good fortune and wealth. The natural
Jovial operations appear on the grade of the Sandals of Mercury
with images representing exercising virtue, exercising friendship.
On the Prometheus level, the Jovial character is represented by
images standing for religion and the law.
Or take, as a contrast, the Saturn series.43 Saturn's association
with the element of earth appears under the Banquet as the image
of Cybele, meaning earth as a simple element; Cybele under the
Cave is earth as a mixed element; Cybele with the Sandals of Mer-cury is natural operations concerned with earth; Cybele with
Prometheus is arts concerned with earth, as geometry, geography,
agriculture. The sadness and solitariness of the Saturnian tempera-ment is expressed by the image of the Solitary Sparrow which
recurs under the Cave, Pasiphe, and Sandals of Mercury. The
mental characteristics of the Saturnian temperament appear under
the Gorgon Sisters in the image of Hercules and Antaeus with its
sense of struggle with earth to rise to heights of contemplation
(compare the easy, aerial ascent of the Jovial mind on this same
grade). Saturn's association with time is expressed under the Cave
in the image of the heads of a wolf, lion, and dog, signifying past,

Melancholy, by R. Klibansky, E. Panofsky, F. Saxl, London, 1964.

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

present, and future.44 The association of this planet with ill
fortune and poverty is expressed by the images of Pandora, in the
Cave, Pasiphe, and Sandals of Mercury grades. One of the hum-blest of the 'occupations of Saturn', carrying and porterage, appears
under Prometheus, symbolised by the Ass.
Once the method is understood, it can be followed in all the
other planetary series. The watery Luna has Neptune for water as
simple element under the Banquet, with the usual variations of the
same image on other grades, and the usual type of allusions to the
Lunar temperament and occupations. The Mercury series works
out very interestingly the Mercurial gifts and aptitudes. The
Venus series does the same for the Venereal side of life. Similarly the
Mars series, which uses Vulcan as the image of fire on the various
grades, alludes to the Martial temperament and occupations.
Most important of all is the great central series on Sol, Apollo,
the Sim, but we reserve discussion of this until later.
So we begin to perceive the vast scope of the Memory Theatre of
the divine Camillo. But let us quote his own words:
This high and incomparable placing not only performs the office
of conserving for us the things, words, and arts which we confide to
it, so that we mayfindthem at once whenever we need them, but also
gives us true wisdom from whose founts we come to the knowledge
of things from their causes and not from their effects. This may be
more clearly expressed from the following illustration. If we were
tofindourselves in a vast forest and desired to see its whole extent
we should not be able to do this from our position within it for our
view would be limited to only a small part of it by the immediately
surrounding trees which would prevent us from seeing the distant
view. But if, near to this forest, there were a slope leading up to a
high hill, on coming out of the forest and ascending the slope we
should begin to see a large part of the form of the forest, and from
the top of the hill we should see the whole of it. The wood is our
inferior world; the slope is the heavens; the hill is the supercelestial
world. And in order to understand the things of the lower world it
is necessary to ascend to superior things, from whence, looking
down from on high, we may have a more certain knowledge of the
inferior things.45

This is the time symbol associated with Serapis and described by
Macrobius; cf. E. Panofsky, 'Signum Triciput: Ein Hellenistisches

L'Idea del Theatro, pp. 11–12.

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

The Theatre is thus a vision of the world and of the nature of
things seen from a height, from the stars themselves and even
from the supercelestial founts of wisdom beyond them.
Yet this vision is very deliberately cast within the framework of
the classical art of memory, using the traditional mnemonic
terminology. The Theatre is a system of memory places, though a
'high and incomparable' placing; it performs the office of a classical
memory system for orators by 'conserving for us the things, words,
and arts which we confide to it.' Ancient orators confided the parts
of the speeches they wished to remember to 'frail places', whereas
Camillo 'wishing to store up eternally the eternal nature of all
things which can be expressed in speech' assigns to them 'eternal
places'.
The basic images in the Theatre are those of the planetary gods.
The affective or emotional appeal of a good memory image—
according to the rules—is present in such images, expressive of the
tranquillity of Jupiter, the anger of Mars, the melancholy of
Saturn, the love of Venus. Here again the Theatre starts with
causes, the planetary causes of the various affects, and the differing
emotional currents running through the seven-fold divisions of the
Theatre from their planetary sources perform that office of stirring
the memory emotionally which was recommended in the classical
art, but perform this organically in relation to causes.
It appears from Viglius's description of the Theatre that under
the images there were drawers, or boxes, or coffers of some kind
containing masses of papers, and on these papers were speeches,
based on the works of Cicero, relating to the subjects recalled by
the images. This system is frequently alluded to in L'Idea del
Theatro, for example in the statement quoted above that the images
on the gates on the fifth grade will have attached to them 'volumes
containing things and words belonging not only to the interior
man but also to the exterior man.' Viglius saw Camillo excitedly
manipulating 'papers' in the Theatre; he was doubtless drawing
out the many 'volumes' from the receptacles for them under the
images. He had hit upon a new interpretation of memory for
'things' and 'words' by storing written speeches under the images
(all this written material from the Theatre appears to have been
lost, though Alessandro Citolini was suspected of having stolen
it and published it under his own name).46 When one thinks of all

these drawers or coffers in the Theatre it begins to look like a
highly ornamental filing cabinet. But this is to lose sight of the
grandeur of the Idea—the Idea of a memory organically geared to
the universe.
Though the art of memory is still using places and images
according to the rules, a radical change had come over the philo-sophy and psychology behind it, which is now no longer scholastic
but Neoplatonic. And Camillo's Neoplatonism is most strongly
infused with those Hermetic influences at the core of the move-ment inaugurated by Marsilio Ficino. The body of writings known
as the Corpus Hermeticum was rediscovered in the fifteenth century
and translated into Latin by Ficino, who believed—and the belief
was universal—that they were the work of the ancient Egyptian
sage, Hermes (or Mercurius) Trismegistus.47 They represented a
tradition of ancient wisdom earlier than Plato, and which had
inspired Plato and the Neoplatonists. Encouraged by some of the
Fathers of the Church, Ficino attached a peculiarly sacred charac-ter to the Hermetic writings as Gentile prophecies of the coming of
Christianity. The Corpus Hermeticum as a sacred book of most
ancient wisdom was almost more important to the Renaissance
Neoplatonist than Plato himself. And the Asclepius, which had
been known in the Middle Ages, was associated with it as another
inspired writing by Trismegistus. The enormous importance of
these Hermetic influences in the Renaissance is coming to be more
and more realised. Camillo's Theatre is impregnated with them,
through and through.
Into the old bottles of the art of memory there has been poured
the heady wine of the currents of Renaissance 'occult philosophy',
running fresh and strong into sixteenth-century Venice from its
springs in the movement inaugurated by Ficino in Florence in the
late fifteenth century. The body of Hermetic doctrine available to
Camillo consisted of the first fourteen treatises of the Corpus
Hermeticum, in Ficino's Latin translation, and the Asclepius in the
Latin translation known in the Middle Ages. He makes numerous
verbal quotations from these works of 'Mercurius Trismegistus'.
In the Hermetic account of creation in the first treatise of the
Corpus, called the Pimander, Camillo had read of how the demiurge
fashioned 'the Seven Governors who envelop with their circles the
47

145

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

sensible world'. He quotes this passage, in Ficino's Latin, stating
that he is quoting 'Mercurio Trismegisto nel Pimandro', and
adding this remark:
And in truth since the divinity produced out of itself these seven
measures, it is a sign that they were always implicitly contained
within the abyss of the divinity.48
The Seven Governors of the Hermetic Pimander are thus behind
those seven measures upon which Camillo founds his Theatre and
which have their continuation into the Sephiroth, into the abyss
of the divinity. The seven are more than planets in the astrological
sense; they are divine astral beings.
After the Seven Governors have been created and set in motion
there comes in the Pimander the account of the creation of man,
which differs radically from the account in Genesis. For the Herme-tic man is created in the image of God in the sense that he is given
the divine creative power. When he saw the newly created Seven
Governors, the Man wished also to produce a work and 'permission
to do this was given him by the Father'.
Having thus entered into the demiurgic sphere in which he had
full power . . . the Governors fell in love with him, and each gave to
him a part in their own rule.49
Man's mind is a direct reflection of the divine mens and has within it
all the powers of the Seven Governors. When he falls into the body
he does not lose this divinity of his mind and he can recover his full
divine nature, as the rest of the Pimander recounts, through the
Hermetic religious experience in which the divine light and life
within his own mens is revealed to him.
In the Theatre, the creation of man is in two stages. He is not
created body and soul together as in Genesis. First there is the
appearance of the 'interior man' on the grade of the Gorgon
Sisters, the most noble of God's creatures, made in his image and
similitude. Then on the grade of Pasiphe and the Bull man takes on
a body the parts of which are under the domination of the zodiac.
This is what happens to man in the Pimander; the interior man,
his mens, created divine and having the powers of the star-rulers,

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

on falling into the body comes under the domination of the stars,
whence he escapes in the Hermetic religious experience of ascent
through the spheres to regain his divinity.
On the grade of the Gorgon Sisters, Camillo discusses what the
creation of man in God's image and similitudes can mean. He
quotes a passage from the Zohar on these words in which they are
interpreted to mean that, though like God, the interior man is not
actually divine. Camillo contrasts this with the Hermetic account:
But Mercurius Trismegistus in his Pimander takes the image and
similitude for the same thing, and the whole for the divine grade.50
He then quotes the opening of the passage in the Pimander on the
creation of man. He is agreeing with Trismegistus, that the interior
man was created 'on the divine grade'. And he follows this up by
quotation of the famous passage in the Asclepius on man, the great
miracle:
Oh Asclepius, what a great miracle is man, a being worthy of
reverence and honour. For he goes into the nature of a god, as
though he were himself a god; he is familiar with the race of
demons, knowing that he is issued from the same origin; he des-pises that part of his nature which is only human, for he has put
his hope in the divinity of the other part.51
This again affirms the divinity of man, and that he belongs to the
same race as the creative star-demons.
The divinity of man's intellect is again affirmed in the twelfth
treatise of the Corpus Hermeticum, and this was a favourite treatise
of Camillo's from which he frequently quotes. The intellect is
drawn from the very substance of God. In men this intellect is
God; and so some men are gods and their humanity is near to the
divinity. The world too is divine; it is a great god, image of a
greater God.52
These Hermetic teachings on the divinity of man's mens in which
Camillo was saturated, are reflected in his memory system. It is
because he believes in the divinity of man that the divine Camillo
makes his stupendous claim of being able to remember the uni-verse by looking down upon it from above, from first causes, as

though he were God.53 In this atmosphere, the relationship
between man, the microcosm, and the world, the macrocosm,
takes on a new significance. The microcosm can fully understand
and fully remember the macrocosm, can hold it within his divine
mens or memory.
A memory system based on such teachings as this, though it uses
the old places and images, must clearly have very different
implications for its user from these of the old times, when man was
allowed to use images in memory as a concession to his weakness.
To the strong Hermetic influences stemming from Ficino's
philosophy, Pico della Mirandola had joined influences from his
popularisation of the Jewish Cabala, in a Christianised form. The
two types of cosmic mysticism have affinities with one another, and
they amalgamated to form the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition, so
powerful a force in the Renaissance after Pico.
That there is a strong Cabalist influence on the Theatre is
obvious. The ten Sephiroth as divine measures in the supercelestial world corresponding to the ten spheres of the universe had
been adopted by Pico from Cabalism. For Camillo, it is the cor-respondence of the seven planetary measures of the celestial
world with the supercelestial Sephiroth which gives the Theatre
its prolongation up into the supercelestial world, into the abyss
of the divine wisdom and the mysteries of the Temple of Solomon.
Camillo has, however, juggled with the normal arrangements. The
correlations between planetary spheres and Jewish Sephiroth and
angels, as he gives them, run thus:
Planets
Luna (Diana)
Mercury
Venus
Sol
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
53

Sephiroth
Marcut
Iesod
Hod and Nisach

Presumably he has made the gnostic ascent through the spheres to
his divine origin. According to Macrobius, souls descend through
Cancer where they drink the cup of forgetfulness of the higher world, and
ascend back to the higher world through Capricorn. See the plan of the
Theatre, Saturn series, Gorgon Sisters grade, 'Girl rising through
Capricorn'; and Luna series, Gorgon Sisters grade, 'Girl drinking from
the cup of Bacchus'.
148

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

He has left out the two highest Sephiroth, Kether and Hokmah.
This was done intentionally, for he explains that he is not going
above Bina, to which Moses ascended, and he therefore stops his
series at Bina-Saturn.54 There is also some confusion or anomaly
in his giving two Sephiroth to Venus. Otherwise his Sephirothplanet correlations are not unusual ones, though F. Secret points
out that he has slightly deformed the names of the Sephiroth and
suggests Egidius of Viterbo as a probable intermediary.55 With
the Sephiroth-planets, Camillo puts seven angels; his angel
correlations are also fairly normal.
As well as the adoption of the Jewish Sephiroth and angels and
their connections with the planetary spheres, there are numerous
other Cabalist influences in the Theatre, the most noteworthy of
which is the quotation from the Zohar on man having three souls;
Nessamah, the highest soul; the middle soul, Ruach; and a lower
soul, Nephes.56 This Cabalistic concept he invests with the image
of the three Gorgon Sisters, with one eye between them, as the
leading image on the grade of the Theatre dealing with the
'interior man'. In his anxiety to make the interior man wholly
divine, with Trismegistus, he emphasises Nessamah. The extra-ordinary medley of Cabalistic, Christian, and philosophical
sources with which Camillo supports his notions is well exemplified
in the explanation which he gives, in his Lettera del rivolgimento
dell'huomo a Dio, of the meaning of the Gorgon Sisters grade in the
Theatre. This letter about the return of man to God is, at bottom, a
commentary on the Theatre, as are other of Camillo's minor
writings. After mentioning Nessamah, Ruach, and Nephes as the
three souls in man symbolised by the Gorgon Sisters in the
Theatre, he expands the meaning of the highest soul thus:
. . . We have three souls, of which the one nearest to God is called
by Mercurius Trismegistus and Plato mens, by Moses the spirit of

life, by St. Augustine the higher part, by David light, when he says
'In thy light shall we see light', and Pythagoras agrees with David
in that celebrated precept, 'No man may speak of God without
light.' Which light is called by Aristotle the intellectus agens, and it
is that one eye by which all the three Gorgon Sisters see, according
to the symbolic theologians. And Mercurius says that if we join
ourselves to this mens we may understand, through the ray from
God which is in it, all things, present, past, and future, all things, I
say, which are in heaven and earth.57
Looking now at the image of the Golden Bough on the Gorgon
Sisters grade of the Theatre, we may understand its meanings: the
intellectus agens, Nessamah or the highest part of the soul, the soul
in general, the rational soul, spirit and life.
Camillo erects his Theatre in the spiritual world of Pico della
Mirandola, the world of Pico's Conclusions and Oration on the
Dignity of Man and Heptalus, with its angelic spheres, Sephiroth,
days of creation, mingled with Mercurius Trismegistus, Plato,
Plotinus, St. John's Gospel, St. Paul's epistles—all that hetero-geneous array of references, pagan, Hebraic, or Christian, through
which Pico moves with such assurance as though he had found the
master-key. Pico's key is the same as that of Camillo. In this world,
man with his mind made in the image of God has the middle place
(compare the Gorgon Sisters grade in the middle of the Theatre).
He can move amidst it with understanding and draw it into him-self with subtle religious magics, Hermetic and Cabalist, which
bring him back on to that divine grade which is his by right. Being
organically related in his origin to the Seven Governors ('Oh what
a miracle is man', cries Pico at the beginning of the Oration,
quoting Mercurius Trismegistus) he can communicate with the
seven planetary rulers of the world. And he can rise beyond these
and hold communion, through Cabalist secrets, with the angels—
moving with his divine mind through all the three worlds, supercelestial, celestial, terrestrial.58 Even so, in the Theatre, does Camillo's mind range through all the worlds. These things must be
hidden under a veil explains Pico. The Egyptians sculptured a
sphinx on their temples, signifying that the mysteries must be kept
inviolate. The highest revelations made to Moses are kept secret

in the Cabala. In exactly the same vein, Camillo, in the opening
pages of the Idea del Theatro speaks of its hidden mysteries.
'Mercurius Trismegistus says that religious speech, full of God, is
violated by the intrusion of the vulgar. For this reason the ancients
. . . sculptured a sphinx on their temples . . . Ezechiel was rebuked
by the Cabalists . . . for having revealed what he had seen . . . let us
now pass in the name of the Lord to speak of our Theatre.'59
Camillo brings the art of memory into line with the new cur-rents now running through the Renaissance. His Memory Theatre
houses Ficino and Pico, Magia and Cabala, the Hermetism and
Cabalism implicit in Renaissance so-called Neoplatonism. He
turns the classical art of memory into an occult art.
Where is the magic in such an occult memory system as this, and
how does it work, or how is it supposed to work ? It was Ficino'sastral magic60 which influenced Camillo and which he was attempt-ing to use.
Ficino's 'spiritus' magic was based on the magical rites des-cribed in the Hermetic Asclepius through which the Egyptians, or
rather the Hermetic pseudo-Egyptians, were said to animate their
statues by drawing into them the divine, or demonic, powers of the
cosmos. Ficino describes in his De vita coelitus comparanda ways of
drawing down the life of the stars, of capturing the astral currents
pouring down from above and using them for life and health. The
celestial life, according to the Hermetic sources, is born on air, or
spiritus, and it is strongest in the sun which is its chief transmitter.
Ficino therefore seeks to cultivate the sun and his therapeutic
astral cult is a revival of sun worship.
Though the Ficinian influence is everywhere present in Camillo's Theatre, it is in the great central series of the Sun that it is
most apparent. Most of Ficino's ideas on the sun are set out in his
De sole,61 though they also appear in his other works. In the De
sole, the Sun is called the statua Dei and is compared to the Trinity.
On the Banquet grade of the Sun series, Camillo places the image
of a pyramid, representing the Trinity. On the gate above this,

where is the main image of Apollo, Camillo sets out a 'light'
series: Sol, Lux, Lumen, Splendor, Calor, Generatio. Ficino has a
similar hierarchical light series in the De sole. The Sun is first of all
God; then Light in the heavens; then Lumen which is a form of
spiritus; then Heat which is lower than Lumen; then Generation,
the lowest of the series. Camillo's series is not quite the same; and
Ficino is not quite consistent in the way he sets out the hierarchy of
light in different works. But Camillo's arrangement is completely
Ficinian in spirit, in its suggestion of a hierarchy descending from
the Sun as God to other forms of light and heat in lower spheres,
transmitting the spiritus in his rays.
Going further up the gates in the Sun series we find on the Cave
grade, the image of Argus with, as one of its meanings, the whole
world vivified by the spirit of the stars, suggestive of one of the
basic principles of Ficinian magic, that the astral spiritus is
transmitted mainly by the sun. And on the Sandals of Mercury
grade, the image of the Golden Chain expresses the operations
of going to the sun, taking in the sun, stretching out towards the
sun, suggestive of the operations of Ficinian solar magic. Camillo's
suns series shows a typically Ficinian combination of sun mysticism
with magical solarianism.
And it is significant that with the image of the Cock and Lion on
the Cave grade, Camillo recounts the lion story, which we have
already heard in a slightly less flattering form from another source:
When the author of this Theatre was in Paris in the place called
the Tornello, being with many other gentlemen in a room the
windows of which overlooked a garden, a Lion escaped from
imprisonment came into this room, and coming up to him from
behind, took hold of him by the thighs with his claws but without
harming him, and began to lick him. And when he turned round,
having felt the touch and breath of the animal—all the others
having fled hither and thither—the Lion humbled itself before him,
as though to ask his forgiveness. This can only mean that this
animal recognised that there was much of Solar Virtue in him.62
62

L'ldea del Theatro, p. 39. The 'Cock and Lion' might have been
suggested by Proclus's De sacra et magia in which it is stated that of these
two solarian creatures, the cock is the more solarian since it sings hymns
to the rising sun. Cf. Walker, Magic, p. 37, note 2.
There is possibly an allusion to the French King in the cock. Cf. Bruno
on the solar French cock, quoted in G.B. and H.T., p. 202.
152

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

The behaviour of this unfortunate lion evidently proved, not only
to the bystanders but to Camillo himself, that the author of the
Theatre was a Solar Magus!
The reader may smile at Camillo's lion, but he should not look
too patronisingly at the great central Sun series in the Theatre.
He should remember that Copernicus, when introducing the
heliocentric hypothesis, quoted the words of Hermes Trismegistus
in the Asclepius on the sun;63 that Giordano Bruno when expound-ing Copernicanism at Oxford associated it with Ficino's De vita
coelitus comparanda;64 that the Hermetic view that the earth is not
immobile because it is alive, quoted by Camillo with the Argus
image on the Cave grade of the Sun series,65 was adapted by Bruno
for his defence of the movement of the earth.66 The Sun series of
the Theatre shows within the mind and memory of a man of the
Renaissance the Sun looming with a new importance, mystical,
emotional, magical, the Sun becoming of central significance. It
shows an inner movement of the imagination towards the Sun
which must be taken into account as one of the factors in the
heliocentric revolution.
Camillo, like Ficino, is a Christian Hermetist, who endeavours to
correlate Hermetic teachings with Christianity. Hermes Trisme-gistus in these circles was a sacred figure, who was believed to have
prophesised the coming of Christianity through his allusions to a
'Son of God'.67 The sanctity of Hermes as a Gentile prophet
helped to make easy the path of a Magus who wished to remain a
Christian. We have already seen that the sun as the most powerful
of the astral gods and the chief transmitter of spiritus is, in his
highest manifestation an image of the Trinity,, for Camillo as for
Ficino. Camillo is, however, rather unusual in identifying the
spiritus proceeding from the Sun, not with the Holy Spirit, as was
usually done, but with the 'spirit of Christ'. Quoting from Corpus
Hermeticum, V, 'That god is both apparent and inapparent',
Camillo identifies the divine spirit latent in the creation, which is

the theme of this treatise, with the Spirit of Christ. He quotes
St. Paul on 'Spiritus Christi, Spiritus vivificans' adding that
'about this Mercurius made a book, Quod Deus latens simul, ac
patens sit' (that is Corpus Hermeticum, V).68 That Camillo was able
to think of the spiritus mundi as the spirit of Christ enabled him to
impart Christian overtones to his ardent adoption of Ficino's
spiritus magic with which his Theatre is redolent.
How would the Ficinian magic be supposed to work within a
memory system using places and images in the classical manner ?
The secret of this is, I believe, that the memory images were
regarded as, so to speak, inner talismans.
The talisman is an object imprinted with an image which has
been supposed to have been rendered magical, or to have magical
efficacy, through having been made in accordance with certain
magical rules. The images of talismans are usually, though not
always, images of the stars, for example, an image of Venus as the
goddess of the planet Venus, or an image of Apollo as the god of the
planet Sol. The handbook of talismanic magic called the Picatrix,
which was well known in the Renaissance, describes the processes
through which talismanic images were supposed to be made
magical by becoming infused with the astral spiritus.69 The
Hermetic book which was the theoretical basis of talismanic magic
was the Asclepius in which the magical religion of the Egyptians is
described. According to the author of the Asclepius the Egyptians
knew how to infuse the statues of their gods with cosmic and
magical powers; by prayers, incantations, and other processes they
gave life to these statues; in other words, the Egyptians knew how
to 'make gods'. The processes by which the Egyptians are said in
the Asclepius to make their statues into gods are similar to the
processes by which a talisman is made.
Ficino made some use of talismans in his magic, as described in
his De vita coelitus comparanda, where he quotes descriptions of
talismanic images, probably derived, some of them, from Picatrix.
It has been shown that the passages in Ficino's book on talismans
are derived with some modifications, from the passages in the
Asclepius on how the Egyptians infused magical and divine powers
into the statues of their gods.70 Ficino was using this magic with

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

caution, and somewhat disguising its basis in the magical passages
in the Asclepius. Nevertheless there can be no doubt that this was
his source, and that he was encouraged to take up talismanic
magic through his respect and reverence for the divine teacher,
Mercurius Trismegistus.
Like all his magic, Ficino's use of talismans was a highly
subjective and imaginative one. His magical practices, whether
poetic and musical incantations, or the use of magicised images,
were really directed towards a conditioning of the imagination to
receive celestial influences. His talismanic images, evolved into
beautiful Renaissance forms, were intended to be held within, in
the imagination of their user. He describes how an image drawn
from astralised mythology could be imprinted inwardly on the
mind with such force that when a person, with this imprint in his
imagination came out into the world of external appearances, these
became unified through the power of the inner image, drawn from
the higher world.71
Such inner, or imaginative, use of talismanic imagery, would
surely find a most suitable vehicle for its use in the occultised
version of the art of memory. If the basic memory images used in
such a memory system had, or were supposed to have, talismanic
power, power to draw down the celestial influences and spiritus
within the memory, such a memory would become that of the
'divine' man in intimate association with the divine powers of the
cosmos. And such a memory would also have, or be supposed to
have, the power of unifying the contents of memory by basing it
upon these images drawn from the celestial world. The images of
Camillo's Theatre seem to be supposed to have in them something
of this power, enabling the 'spectator' to read off at one glance,
through 'inspecting the images' the whole contents of the universe.
The 'secret', or one of the secrets, of the Theatre is, I believe, that
the basic planetary images are supposed to be talismans, or to have
talismanic virtue, and that the astral power from them is supposed
to run through the subsidiary images—a Jupiter power, for
example, running through all the images in the Jupiter series, or a
Sun power through the Sun series. In this way, the cosmically
based memory would be supposed, not only to draw power from
the cosmos into the memory, but to unify memory. All the details
71

Cf. G.B. and H.T., pp. 75–6.
155

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

of the world of sense, reflected in memory, would be unified
organically within the memory, because subsumed and unified
under the higher celestial images, the images of their 'causes'.
If this was the theory of underlying the images of Camillo's
occult memory system, it would have been based on the magical
passages in the Asclepius. The 'god making' passages in that work
are not quoted or referred to in L'Idea del Theatro, but in a speech
about his Theatre, which he probably delivered in some Venetian
academy, Camillo does refer to the magic statues of the Asclepius,
and gives a very subtle interpretation of their magic.
I have read, I believe in Mercurius Trismegistus, that in Egypt
there were such excellent makers of statues that when they had
brought some statue to the perfect proportions it was found to be
animated with an angelic spirit: for such perfection could not be
without a soul. Similar to such statues, I find a composition of
words, the office of which is to hold all the words in a proportion
grateful to the ear . . . Which words as soon as they are put into
their proportion are found when pronounced to be as it were
animated by a harmony.72
Camillo has interpreted the magic of the Egyptian statues in an
artistic sense; a perfectly proportioned statue becomes animated
with a spirit, becomes a magic statue.
This seems to me to be a pearl of great price with which Giulio
Camillo has presented us, an interpretation of the magic statues of
the Asclepius in terms of the magical effect of perfect proportions.
Such a development could have been suggested by the statement
in the Asclepius that the Egyptian magicians maintained the
celestial spirit in their magic statues with celestial rites, reflecting
the harmony of heaven.73 Renaissance theory of proportion was
based on the 'universal harmony', the harmonious proportions of
the world, the macrocosm, reflected in the body of man, the micro-cosm. To make a statue in accordance with the rules of proportion
could thus be a way of introducing into it the celestial harmony,
thereby imparting to it a magical animation.
Applied to the inner talismanic images of an occult memory
system, this would mean that the magical power of such images
would consist in their perfect proportions. Camillo's memory

system would reflect the perfectly proportioned images of Renais-sance art, and in this their magic would consist. One becomes
seized with an intense desire to have that opportunity of inspecting
the images in the Theatre which was rather wasted on the friend of
Erasmus.
These subtleties did not save Camillo from the charge of having
dabbled in dangerous magic. One Pietro Passi, who published a
book on natural magic at Venice in 1614, warns against the statues
of the Asclepius, 'of which Cornelius Agrippa has dared to affirm
in his book on Occult Philosophy that they were animated by
celestial influences.'
And Giulio Camillo, otherwise a judicious and polite writer, is not
far off from this error in the Discorso in materia del suo Theatro,
where, in speaking of the Egyptian statues, he says that the celestial
influences descend into statues which are constructed with rare
proportions. In which both he and others are in error . . .74
Camillo thus did not escape the accusation of being a magician
which any dabbling in the magical passages of the Asclepius
always brought with it. And Passi's accusation shows that the
'secret' of the Theatre was indeed supposed to be a magical secret.
The Theatre presents a remarkable transformation of the art of
memory. The rules of the art are clearly discernible in it. Here is
a building divided into memory places on which are memory
images. Renaissance in its form, for the memory building is no
longer a Gothic church or cathedral, the system is also Renaissance
in its theory. The emotionally striking images of classical memory,
transformed by the devout Middle Ages into corporeal similitudes,
are transformed again into magically powerful images. The reli-gious intensity associated with mediaeval memory has turned in a
new and bold direction. The mind and memory of man is now
'divine', having powers of grasping the highest reality through a
magically activated imagination. The Hermetic art of memory has

eccentric eighteenth-century German sculptor, F. X. Messerschmidt,
who combined an intense religious cult of Hermes Trismegistus with
intense study of an 'old Italian book' on proportion (see R. and M .

become the instrument in the formation of a Magus, the imagina-tive means through which the divine microcosm can reflect the
divine macrocosm, can grasp its meaning from above, from that
divine grade to which his mens belongs. The art of memory has
become an occult art, a Hermetic secret.
When Viglius asked Camillo concerning the meaning of the
work as they both stood in the Theatre, Camillo spoke of it as
representing all that the mind can conceive and all that is hidden in
the soul—all of which could be perceived at one glance by the
inspection of the images. Camillo is trying to tell Viglius the
'secret' of the Theatre, but an immense and unbridgeable gulf of
mutual incomprehension lies between the two men.
Yet both were products of the Renaissance. Viglius represents
Erasmus, the humanist scholar, opposed by temperament and
training to all that mysterious occult side of the Renaissance to
which Camillo belongs. The meeting of Viglius and Camillo in the
Theatre does not represent a conflict between north and south. At
the time of this meeting Cornelius Agrippa had already written his
De occulta philosophia which was to carry the occult philosophy all
through the north. The meeting in the Theatre represents a con-flict between two different types of mind which take up different
sides of the Renaissance. The rational humanist is Erasmus-Viglius.
The irrationalist, Camillo, descends from the Renaissance on its
occult side.
For the Erasmian type of humanist the art of memory was dying
out, killed by the printed book, unfashionable because of its
mediaeval associations, a cumbrous art which modern educators
are dropping. It was in the occult tradition that the art of memory
was taken up again, expanded into new forms, infused with a new
life.
The rational reader, if he is interested in the history of ideas,
must be willing to hear about all ideas which in their time have
been potent to move men. The basic changes of orientation within
the psyche which are shown to us by Camillo's memory system
have vital connections with changes of outlook out of which new
movements were to come. The Hermetic impulse towards the
world and its workings is a factor in turning men's minds towards
science. Camillo is nearer than Erasmus to the scientific move-ments, still veiled in magic, which are stirring obscurely in the
Venetian academies.
158

THE MEMORY THEATRE OF GIULIO CAMILLO

And for the understanding of the creative impulses behind the
artistic achievements of the Renaissance, of those celestial har-monies of perfect proportion which the divine artists and poets
knew how to infuse into their works, the divine Camillo with his
subtle artistic magics has something to tell us.

159

Chapter VII

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE
VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

HE phenomenon of the Theatre, once so famous and so
T
long forgotten, suggests many problems, a few of which
will be briefly raised in this chapter, though a whole book
might be written on this subject. Did Camillo invent his
momentous transformation of the art of memory, or was it
already adumbrated in the Florentine movement whence he drew
his inspiration ? Was such a view of memory seen as a total break
with the older memory tradition, or was there any continuity
between the old and the new? And, finally, what are the links
between the memory monument which Camillo raised in the
midst of the Venetian Renaissance of the early sixteenth century
and other Renaissance manifestations in that time and place ?
Ficino certainly knew of the art of memory. In one of his
letters he gives some precepts for improving the memory in the
course of which he lets fall the following remark:
Aristotle and Simonides think it useful to observe a certain order
in memorising. And indeed an order contains proportion, harmony
and connection. And if matters are digested into a series, if you
think of one, others follow as by natural necessity.1
Simonides in connection with memory must mean the classical art;
and his association with Aristotle may mean the classical art as
transmitted by the scholastics. Proportion and harmony are, so far

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

as I know, new and significant Ficinian additions to the memory
tradition. Ficino therefore had the materials for doing what
Camillo did, for housing a Hermetised art of memory in a memory
building stored with the talismanic, astralised mythological
imagery which he was such an adept at inventing. In the De vita
coelitus comparanda he speaks of constructing an 'image of the
world'.2 To form such an image within an artistic architectural
framework within which astral memory imagery was skilfully
arranged might have been very congenial to Ficino. One wonders
whether some of the peculiarities of Ficino's imagery, the
fluctuating meanings which he attaches to the same image—the
image of the Three Graces for example3—might be explained if
the same image were to be thought of as on different grades, as in
Camillo's Theatre.
I do not know of any actual mention of the art of memory in Pico
della Mirandola's works, though the opening words of his Oration
on the Dignity of Man might have suggested the form of Camillo's
memory building:
I have read in the writings of the Arabs that Abdullah the Saracen,
when asked what seemed to him most marvellous in this theatre
of the world (mundana scaena) replied that nothing seemed to him
more splendid than man. And this accords with the famous saying
of Mercurius Trismegistus, 'What a miracle is man, O Asclepius.'4
Pico is of course here speaking of the world as a theatre only in a
general sense, as a well known topos.5 Yet the description of
Camillo's Theatre is so full of echoes of the Oration, that it is
possible that its opening allusion to Hermetic man as dominating
the theatre of the world might have suggested the theatre form for
the Hermetic memory system.6 But it remains unknown whether
Pico had himself thought of constructing a 'theatre of the world'

illustrating the lay-out of his mind as expressed in the Heptaplus,
as Camillo's Theatre does.
Though these are but fragmentary suggestions, it is, I think,
unlikely that the occult memory system was invented by Camillo.
More probably he was developing in a Venetian setting an inward
use of Hermetic and Cabalist influences in the framework of the
classical art of memory which had been earlier adumbrated by
Ficino and Pico. Nevertheless the fact that his Theatre was so
universally acclaimed as a novel and striking achievement shows
that it was he who first put Renaissance occult memory on a firm
basis. And, so far as the historian of the art of memory is con-cerned, his Theatre is the first great landmark in the story of the
transformation of the art of memory through the Hermetic and
Cabalist influences implicit in Renaissance Neoplatonism.
There can be no possible connection, one would suppose,
between the occult transformation of artificial memory and the
earlier memory tradition. But let us look once again at the plan of
the Theatre.
Saturn was the planet of melancholy, good memory belonged to
the melancholic temperament, and memory was a part of Pru-dence. All this is indicated in the Saturn series of the Theatre
where, on the Cave grade, we see the famous time symbol of the
heads of a wolf, a lion, and a dog, signifying past present and
future. This could be used as a symbol of Prudence and her three
parts of memoria, intelligentia,providentia,as shown in the famous
picture by Titian, labelled 'Prudence' (P1. 8a), of a man's face
with the three animal heads below it. Camillo, who moved in the
main Venetian artistic and literary circles is rumoured to have
known Titian,7 but in any case would know of the three animal
heads as a symbol of Prudence in her time aspect. And now,
continuing to look at the Saturn series of the Theatre, we perceive
that the image of Cybele vomiting fire on the Banquet grade of this
series means Hell. Remembering Hell as a part of Prudence is thus
represented in the Theatre. Moreover, the image of Europa and
the Bull on the Banquet grade of Jupiter means true religion or
Paradise. The image of the Mouth of Tartarus on the Banquet
grade of Mars means Purgatory. The image of a sphere with
7

Altani di Salvarolo, p. 266.
162

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

Ten Circles on the Banquet grade of Venus means the Earthly
Paradise.
Thus beneath the splendid Renaissance surface of the Theatre
there still survives artificial memory of the Dantesque type. What
did the coffers or boxes under the images of Hell, Purgatory, the
Earthly Paradise, and Paradise in the Theatre contain? Hardly
Ciceronian speeches surely. They must have been full of sermons.
Or of cantos of the Divine Comedy. In any case, we certainly have
in these images vestiges of older uses and interpretations of
artificial memory.
Moreover, there is probably some connection between the stir
caused by Camillo's Theatre and the revival of interest in Venice
in the Dominican memory tradition. As already mentioned,
Lodovico Dolce, the ready purveyor of literature likely to be
popular, wrote the preface for the collected edition of Camillo's
works (1552), which included L'Idea del Theatro, in which he
spoke of Camillo's 'more divine than human intellect'. Ten years
later, Dolce came out with a work on memory in Italian,8 very
elegantly expressed in the fashionable dialogue form, modelled on
Cicero's De oratore; one of the speakers is Hortensio, recalling the
Hortensius in Cicero's work. This little book has a surface of
Venetian Ciceronianism in the volgare, classical rhetoric in Italian,
which is exactly the style of the Bembist school to which Camillo had
belonged (as will appear later). But what is this modern-looking
dialogue on memory by Dolce, the admirer of Camillo ? It is a
translation, or rather adaptation, of Romberch's 'Congestion'. The
crabbed Latin of the German Dominican is transformed into
elegant Italian dialogues, some of his examples are modernised, but
the substance of the book is Romberch. We hear in the dulcet
tones of Dolce's 'Ciceronian' Italian the scholastic reason why
images may be used in memory. And Romberch's diagrams are
exactly reproduced; we see once again his cosmic diagram for
Dantesque artificial memory, and the antiquated figure of Gram-mar, stuck over with visual alphabets.
Amongst Dolce's expansions of Romberch's text, is the one,
mentioned earlier, in which he brings in the allusion to Dante as a
guide to remembering Hell.9 Other expansions by Dolce are

la memoria, Venice, 1562 (also 1575, 1586).

See above, p. 95.

163

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

modernisations of Romberch's memory instructions through
bringing in modern artists whose pictures are useful as memory
images. For example:
If we have some familiarity with the art of painters we shall be more
skilful in forming our memory images. If you wish to remember
the fable of Europa you may use as your memory image Titian's
painting: also for Adonis, or any other fabulous history, profane
or sacred, choosing figures which delight and thereby excite the
memory.10
Thus, whilst recommending Dantesque imagery for remembering
Hell, Dolce also brings the memory image up to date by recom-mending mythological forms as painted by Titian.
The publication of Rossellius's book at Venice in 1579 is another
indication of the popularity of the older memory tradition. As well
as its powerful exposition of Dantesque artificial memory, this book
also reflects some more modern trends. An example of this is
Rossellius's choice of notable practitioners of arts and sciences to
'place' in memory as memory images of them. This most ancient
tradition, going right back to remote Greek antiquity, when they
placed Vulcan for Metallurgy,10a and of which we have seen one
mediaeval example in the row of figures placed in front of the arts
and sciences in the Chapter House fresco glorifying Thomas
Aquinas, is being carried on by Rossellius:
Thus for Grammar, I place Lorenzo Valla or Priscian; for Rhe-toric I place Marcus Tullius; for Dialectic Aristotle, and also for
philosophy; for Theology Plato . . . for Painting, Phidias or Zeuxis
. . . for Astrology, Atlas, Zoroaster, or Ptolomey; for Geometry,
Archimedes; for Music, Apollo, Orpheus . . .11
Are we now looking at Raphael's 'School of Athens' as useful for
memory and 'placing' his Plato as Theology, his Aristotle as
Philosophy ? In the same passage, Rossellius 'places' Pythagoras
and Zoroaster as representing 'Magia, and this in a list of figures
which he is placing for remembering virtues. It is interesting to
find that 'Magia' has moved up into the virtues, and there are
other indications in Rossellius's book that the Dominican memory
tradition is moving in modern directions.

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

Infiltration of Neoplatonism into the older memory tradition is
also present in the Plutosofia by the Franciscan, Gesualdo,
published at Padua in 1592.12 Gesualdo opens his chapter on the
art of memory with quotations from Ficino in the Libri de vita
(Gesualdo might be used in future efforts to solve the problem of
Ficino and memory). He sees memory on three levels; it is like
the Ocean, father of waters, for from memory flow all words and
thoughts; it is like the heaven, with its lights and operations; it
is the divine in man, the image of God in the soul. In another
passage he compares memory to the highest celestial sphere (the
zodiac) and to the highest supercelestial sphere (the sphere of the
Seraphim). Clearly Gesualdo's memory moves amongst the three
worlds, in a manner similar to that shown in the lay-out of the
Theatre. Yet after his Ficinian and Camillan introduction,
Gesualdo devotes the bulk of his treatise to the old type of memory
material.
Thus it would appear that the older memory tradition mingled
with the new type of occult memory, that the thunders of a friar's
sermon on rewards and punishments, or the warnings of the
Divine Comedy, might still be heard echoing somehow together
with, or below the surface of, the new style of oratory with its new
style arrangement of memory, and that our discovery of Hell,
Purgatory, and Paradise in Camillo's Theatre belongs into a
general atmosphere in which old style memory merges with the
new. The Renaissance occult philosopher had a great gift for
ignoring differences and seeing only resemblances. Ficino was able
happily to combine the Summa of Thomas Aquinas with his own
brand of Platonic theology, and it would be quite in keeping with
the general confusion if he and his followers failed to notice any
essential difference between Thomas Aquinas's recommendation
of 'corporeal similitudes' in memory and the astralised images of
occult memory.
Camillo belongs, not to the Florentine Renaissance of the late
fifteenth century, but to the Venetian Renaissance of the early
sixteenth century, in which the Florentine influences were ab-sorbed but took on characteristically Venetian forms, one of the
most characteristic of which was Ciceronian oratory. The recom-mendation of the artificial memory in De oratore, a work devoutly

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

imitated by the 'Ciceroniani', would carry weight in these fashion-able circles. Camillo was himself an orator and an admirer of
Cardinal Bembo, the leader of the 'Ciceroniani', to whom he
dedicated a Latin poem about his Theatre.13 The memory system
of the Theatre is intended to be used for memorising every notion
to be found in Cicero's works; the drawers under the images
contained Ciceronian speeches. The system, with its HermeticCabalist philosophy and foundation, belongs into the world of
Venetian oratory, as the memory system of a 'Ciceronianus' who
intends to deliver Ciceronian speeches in the volgare. Such was
the material which Camillo drew out of the drawers and recited
with such excitement to Viglius.
With the Theatre, the art of memory has returned to its clas-sical position as a part of rhetoric, as the art used by the great
Cicero. Yet it is not as a 'straight mnemotechnic' that it is being
used by the Venetian Ciceronian. One of the most purely classical
in appearance of Renaissance phenomena, the revival of Ciceronian
oratory, is here found associated with a mystico-magical artificial
memory. And this revelation of what the memory of a Venetian
orator could be like is important for the investigation of Erasmus's
well-known attack on the Ciceronians of Italy in his Ciceronianus
(1528). A fierce anonymous reply to this work, which was both a
defence of the Ciceronians and a personal attack on Erasmus, had
been published in 1531. Its author was Julius Caesar Scaliger, but
this was not known at the time, and suspicion had fallen on Giulio
Camillo as possibly the author. Viglius believed this, and the er-roneous conviction that Camillo had attacked his famous friend is
behind Viglius's reports to Erasmus about the Theatre.14
No one has suspected that Erasmus's objections to the 'Ciceroniani' might have included distaste for a tendency to occultism.
This may or may not be the case. But at any rate the Ciceronianus
controversy should not be studied without reference to Camillo
and his Theatre, and what was said about it in the Venetian
academies.
The proliferation of academies was a notable phenomenon of the

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

Venetian Renaissance, and Camillo is a typical Venetian academi-cian. He is said to have himself founded an academy;15 several of
his surviving literary remains probably originated as academic
discourses; and his Theatre was still being discussed more than
forty years after his death in a Venetian academy. This was the
Accademia degli Uranici, founded in 1587 by Fabio Paolini who
published a large volume, entided Hebdomades, reflecting dis-courses made in this academy. It is divided into seven books, each
containing seven chapters, and 'seven' is the mystical theme of the
whole.
Paolini's thick volume has been studied by D. P. Walker,16
who regards it as representing the occult core of Renaissance
Neoplatonism as it had developed when transferred from Florence
to Venice. Here are the Hermetic influences operating in the
Venetian setting. Within the seven-fold arrangement, Paolini
presents 'not only the whole theory of Ficino's magic, but also the
whole complex of theories of which it is a part.'17 He quotes the
passage on the magic statues from the Asslepiusand goes as far as
he dares in the magical direction. It may be added that he was
also interested in Cabala, and in the angel magic of Trithemius,
quoting the names of the Cabalistic angels which go with the
planets in the same form as they are given by Camillo.18
One of the chief aims of Paolini and his academy, as revealed in
the Hebdomades, was to apply the magical theories to that leading
interest of the Venetians, oratory. Ficino's theories about 'plane-tary music' designed to draw down planetary powers through
musical correspondencies, were transferred by Paolini to oratory.
'He believed', says Walker, 'that just as a proper mixture of tones
could give music a planetary power, so a proper mixture of "forms"
could produce a celestial power in an oration . . . The set (of
forms) has something to do with the number seven, and some of
the things are the sounds of words, figures of speech, and Hermogenes' seven Ideas, that is the general qualities of good oratory.'19

16

167

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

The close connection of Paolini's ideas on magical oratory with
Camillo's memory system for orators, based on seven, is obvious,
and indeed Paolini quotes long passages from L'Idea del Theatro,
including the one describing its seven-fold construction, based on
the planetary seven.20 The Hebdomades might take the place of the
great work explaining the background of his Theatre which
Camillo himself never wrote. And we learn from it that a kind of
'planetary oratory' was envisaged which should produce effects on
its hearers, like the fabled effects of ancient music, since the words
of the speaker were activated by planetary influences drawn into
them.
The Hebdomades discovers for us a 'secret' of Camillo's Theatre
which otherwise we would never have guessed. As well as provid-ing a magically activated, because based on the fundamental
Seven, memory system for orators, the Theatre also magically
activated the speeches which the orator remembered by it, infusing
them with planetary virtue through which they would have
magical effects on the hearers. It may be suggested that Camillo's
interpretation of the magic of the statues of the Asclepius may be of
importance here. The connection of the right and perfect and
therefore magical forms of oratory with the magic memory image
might be through the interpretation of the magic statues whereby
their power is due to their reflection of celestial harmony through
their perfect proportions. Thus the perfect proportions of, let us
say, the magical Apollo image, would produce the perfectly
proportioned, and therefore magical, speech about the sun. The
Venetian magicians are presenting us with extremely subtle
interpretations of the magic of the Renaissance.

in the seven forms of good oratory laid down by Hermogenes (the Greek
writer on rhetoric of the first century A.D.) probably connected with the
'sevens' mystique. Camillo had also been interested in Hermogenes; see
the Discorso di M. Giulio Camillo sopra Hermogene, in Tutte le opere, ed. cit.,
II, pp. 77 ff.
Paolini makes the remark that J. C. Scaliger believed in the seven forms
of Hermogenes and showed them 'quasi in Theatrum' (Hebdomades,
p. 24). I do not know to what work of Scaliger's this can refer, but the
remark may suggest that Paolini saw Erasmus's opponent as belonging
to the mystical 'Sevens' school in rhetoric and memory.
168

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

We now begin to understand the huge fame of Camillo's
Theatre. To those outside the Renaissance occult tradition, it was
the work of a charlatan and an imposter. To those within that
tradition, it held an unbounded fascination. It proposed to show
how Man, the great Miracle, who could harness the powers of the
cosmos with Magia and Cabala as described in Pico's Oration on
the Dignity of Man, might develop magical powers as an orator by
speaking from a memory organically affiliated to the proportions of
the world harmony. Francesco Patrizi, the Hermetic philosopher of
Ferrara, speaks with ecstacy of how Camillo has released the pre-cepts of the masters of rhetoric from narrow bounds, extending
them to 'the most ample places of the Theatre of the whole
world'.21
In ancient rhetorical theory, oratory is closely bound up with
poetry, as Camillo, himself a Petrarchan poet, was fully aware. And
it is with a certain amazement—as of stumbling upon something
strange—that one finds that Camillo is mentioned with approval
by the two most famous Italian poets of the sixteenth century. In
Ariosto's Orlando furioso, Giulio Camillo appears as 'he who
showed a smoother and shorter way to the heights of Helicon'.22
And Torquato Tasso discusses at some length in one of his dia-logues the secret which Camillo revealed to the King of France,
stating that Camillo was the first since Dante who showed that
rhetoric is a kind of poetry.23 To find Ariosto and Tasso among the
hosts of Camillo's admirers forbids us to dismiss the Theatre as
historically unimportant.
Another manifestation of the Renaissance with which the tone of
the Theatre is in keeping is the symbolic statement in the form of
the impresa or device. Some of the images in the Theatre are very
like imprese, the fashion for which was being particularly developed
in Venice in Camillo's time. The impresa is related to the memory
image, as already suggested, and in commentaries on imprese there

is frequently to be found a blend of Hermetic-Cabalist mysticism
like that which inspires the Theatre. An example is the device
shown by Ruscelli of a heliotrope turning towards the sun, ex-pounded in the commentary on it with many allusions to Mercurius Trismegistus and the Cabala.24 Among the symbols of
Achilles Bocchius who, like many of the writers on symbols and
imprese of the period, belonged into the circle of the famous
Camillo, we see a figure (Frontispiece) wearing the winged hat of
Mercury, but holding, not the caduceus, but the seven-branched
golden candlestick of the Apocalypse.25 The accompanying Latin
poem makes it clear that this figure is Mercurius Trismegistus; he
puts his finger to his lips to enjoin silence. This figure would do
very well as a symbolic statement about the Theatre, with its
Hermetic mysteries and its mystical Sevens.
The Theatre thus stands in the midst of the Venetian Renais-sance, organically related to some of its most characteristic products,
its oratory, its imagery, and, it may be added, its architecture.
The revival of Vitruvius by the Venetian architects, culminat-ing in Palladio, is surely one of the most distinctive features of the
Venetian Renaissance, and here, too, Camillo with his adaptation
of the Vitruvian theatre to his mnemonic purposes is at the centre.
The classical theatre, as described by Vitruvius, reflects the pro-portions of the world. The positions of the seven gangways in the
auditorium and of the five entrances on to the stage are determined
by the points of four equilateral triangles inscribed within a circle,
the centre of which is the centre of the orchestra. These triangles,
says Vitruvius, correspond to the trigona which astrologers
24

G. Ruscelli, Imprese illustri, ed. of Venice, 1572, pp. 209 ff. Ruscelli
states that he knew Camillo (Trattato del modo di comporre in versi nella
lingua italiana, Venice, 1594, p. 14). Another disciple of Camillo's was
Alessandro Farra whose Settenario della humana riduttione, Venice, 1571,
contains a discussion of the philosophy of the impresa.

John Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica (Antwerp, 1564) is a composite
symbol of the seven planets, based on the character for Mercury, and
which moves in a similar kind of country of the mind to the Bocchius
symbol of Mercurius with the seven-branched candlestick. So, later on,
will Jacob Boehme meditate Hermetically on the seven forms of his
spiritual alchemy.
170

CAMILLO'S THEATRE AND THE VENETIAN RENAISSANCE

inscribe within the circle of the zodiac.26 The circular form of the
theatre thus reflects the zodiac, and the seven entrances to the
auditorium and the five entrances to the stage correspond to
positions of the twelve signs and of the four triangles connecting
them. This arrangement can be seen in the plan of the Roman
theatre (P1. 9a) in Daniele Barbaro's commentary on Vitruvius,
first published at Venice in 1556,27 the illustrations of which were
influenced by Palladio.28 The plan which Barbaro illustrates is thus
really Palladio's reconstruction of the Roman theatre. Here we see
four triangles inscribed within the circle of the theatre. The base of
one of them is seen to determine the position of the frons scaenae or
back of the stage; its apex points towards the central gangway of the
auditorium. Six other triangle apices mark the positions of six
other gangways; and five triangle apices mark the positions of the
five doors in the frons scaenae.
This was the Vitruvian type of theatre which Camillo had in
mind, but which he distorted by decorating with images, not the
five doors of the stage, but his imaginary gates in the seven gang-ways of the auditorium. But though he distorts the Vitruvian
theatre for his mnemonic purposes, Camillo was certainly aware
of the astrological theory underlying it. He would think of his
Memory Theatre of the World as magically reflecting the divine
world proportions in its architecture as well as in its imagery.
Camillo erected his Memory Theatre in Venice at a time when
the revival of the ancient theatre, due to the recovery of the text of
Vitruvius by the humanists, was in full swing.29 It was to cul-minate in the Teatro Olimpico (P1. 9b), designed by Palladio and
erected at Vicenza in thefifteen-eighties.One wonders whether the
Idea of Camillo's Theatre, so famous in its time and so long the
subject of discussion in academies, may have had some influence
on both Barbaro and Palladio. The mythological images which

decorate the frons scaenae of the Teatro Olimpico are extraordina-rily elaborate. This theatre does not, of course, reverse the arrange-ment of the Vitruvian theatre, as Camillo did, by transferring the
decorated doors from the stage to the auditorium. Yet it has a
certain unreal and imaginative quality.
We have tried in these chapters to reconstruct a vanished
wooden theatre, the fame of which was great, not only in Italy but
also in France, whither it was exported. Why does this vanished
wooden theatre seem to connect so mysteriously with many
aspects of the Renaissance ? It is, I would suggest, because it
represents a new Renaissance plan of the psyche, a change which
has happened within memory, whence outward changes derived
their impetus. Mediaeval man was allowed to use his low faculty
of imagination to form corporeal similitudes to help his memory;
it was a concession to his weakness. Renaissance Hermetic man
believes that he has divine powers; he can form a magic memory
through which he grasps the world, reflecting the divine macrocosm
in the microcosm of his divine mens. The magic of celestial
proportion flows from his world memory into the magical words
of his oratory and poetry, into the perfect proportions of his art and
architecture. Something has happened within the psyche, releasing
new powers, and the new plan of artificial memory may help us
to understand the nature of that inner event.

Chapter VIII

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

we have now reached the Renaissance, with
Camillo, we have to retrace our steps to the Middle Ages
during this chapter. For there was another kind of art of
memory which began in the Middle Ages, which con-tinued into the Renaissance and beyond, and which it was the aim
of many in the Renaissance to combine with the classical art in some
new synthesis whereby memory should reach still further heights
of insight and of power. This other art of memory was the Art of
Ramon Lull.
Lullism and its history is a most difficult subject and one for the
exploration of which the full materials have not yet been assembled.
The enormous number of Lull's own writings, some of them still
unpublished, the vast Lullist literature written by his followers,
the extreme complexity of Lullism, make it impossible as yet to
reach very definite conclusions about what is, undoubtedly, a
strand of major importance in the European tradition. And what I
have to do now is to write one not very long chapter giving some
idea of what the Art of Ramon Lull was like, of why it was an art of
memory, of how it differs from the classical art of memory, and of
how Lullism became absorbed at the Renaissance into Renaissance
forms of the classical art.
Obviously I am attempting the impossible, yet the impossible
must be attempted because it is essential for the later part of this
book that there should be some sketch at this stage of Lullism
itself. The chapter is based on my own two articles on the art of
Ramon Lull; 1 it is orientated towards a comparison of Lullism as

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

an art of memory with the classical art; and it is not concerned
solely with 'genuine' Lullism but also with the Renaissance
interpretation of Lullism, for it is this which is important for the
next stages of our history.
Ramon Lull was about ten years younger than Thomas Aquinas.
He was propagating his Art at the time when the mediaeval form
of the classical art of memory, as laid down and encouraged by
Albertus and Thomas, was in its most flourishing state. Born about
1235 in Majorca, he passed his youth as a courtier and troubadour.
(He never had any regular clerical education.) About the year 1272,
he had an illuminative experience on Mount Randa, an island in
Majorca, in which he saw the attributes of God, his goodness,
greatness, eternity, and so on, infusing the whole creation, and
realised that an Art founded on those attributes might be cons-tructed which would be universally valid because based on reality.
Shortly afterwards he produced the earliest version of his Art. The
whole of the rest of his life was spent in writing books about the
Art, of which he made various versions, the last being the Ars
Magna of 1305–8, and in propagating it with the utmost zeal. He
died in 1316.
In one of its aspects, the Lullian Art is an art of memory. The
divine attributes which are its foundation form themselves into a
Trinitarian structure through which it became, in Lull's eyes, a
reflection of the Trinity, and he intended that it should be used by
all those three powers of the soul which Augustine defined as the
reflection of the Trinity in man. As intellectus, it was an art of
knowing or finding out truth; as voluntas it was an art of training
the will towards loving truth; as memoria, it was an art of memory
for remembering truth. 2 One is reminded of the scholastic formu-lations concerning the three parts of Prudence, memoria, intelligentia, providentia, the artificial memory belonging to one of the
parts. Lull was certainly aware of the Dominican art of memory,

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

looming with immense force in his age, and he was strongly
attracted to the Dominicans and tried to interest the Order in his
own Art, but without success.3 The Dominicans had their own
art of memory. But the other great Order of preaching friars, the
Franciscans, evinced an interest in Lull, and Lullism in its later
history is very often to be found associated with Franciscans.
It is a fact of some historical importance that the two great
mediaeval methods, the classical art of memory in its mediaeval
transformation and the art of Ramon Lull, were both rather
particularly associated with the mendicant orders, the one with the
Dominicans the other with the Franciscans. Owing to the mobility
of the friars, this meant that these two mediaeval methods were
pretty well diffused all over Europe.
Though the Art of Lull in one of its aspects can be called an art
of memory, it must be strongly emphasised that there are the most
radical differences between it and the classical art in almost every
respect. I want to drive this home by running over, before we start
on Lullism, some of these essential differences.
Take, first of all, the question of their respective origins.
Lullism as an art of memory does not come out of the classical
rhetoric tradition, like the other art of memory. It comes out of a
philosophical tradition, that of Augustinian Platonism to which
other, much more strongly Neoplatonic, influences have been
added. It claims to know first causes, called by Lull the Dignities
of God. All Lull's arts are based on these Dignitates Dei, which are
Divine Names or attributes, thought of as primordial causes as in
the Neoplatonic system of Scotus Erigena by which Lull was
influenced.
Contrast this with scholastic memory, which comes out of the
rhetoric tradition, which claims only to clothe spiritual intentions
in corporeal similitudes, and not to base memory on philosophic
'reals'. This divergence indicates a basic underlying philosophical
difference between Lullism and scholasticism. Though Lull's life
was passed in the great age of scholasticism, he was in spirit a man
of the twelfth century rather than of the thirteenth, a Platonist, and
a reactionary towards the Christian Platonism of Anselm and the
Victorines to which was added a strong dose of more extreme
3

On at least three occasions, Lull attended the Chapter General of the
Dominicans in the hope of interesting the Order in his Art; see E. A.
Peers, Ramon Lull, A Biography, London, 1929, pp. 153, 159, 192, 203.

175

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

Neoplatonism from Scotus Erigena. Lull was not a scholastic, he
was a Platonist, and in his attempt to base memory on Divine
Names which verge on Platonic Ideas in his conception of them4
he is closer to the Renaissance than to the Middle Ages.
Secondly, there is nothing corresponding to the images of the
classical art in Lullism as taught by Lull himself, none of that effort
to excite memory by emotional and dramatic corporeal similitudes
which creates that fruitful interaction between the art of memory
and the visual arts. Lull designates the concepts used in his art by a
letter notation, which introduces an almost algebraic or scientifically
abstract note into Lullism.
Finally, and this is probably the most significant aspect of
Lullism in the history of thought, Lull introduces movement into
memory. The figures of his Art, on which its concepts are set out
in the letter notation, are not static but revolving. One of the
figures consists of concentric circles, marked with the letter
notations standing for the concepts, and when these wheels
revolve, combinations of the concepts are obtained. In another
revolving figure, triangles within a circle pick up related concepts.
These are simple devices, but revolutionary in their attempt to
represent movement in the psyche.
Think of the great mediaeval encyclopaedic schemes, with all
knowledge arranged in static parts, made yet more static in the
classical art by the memory buildings stocked with the images.
And then think of Lullism, with its algebraic notations, breaking up
the static schemata into new combinations on its revolving wheels.
The first art is the more artistic, but the second is the more
scientific.
For Lull himself, the great aim of the Art was a missionary aim.
He believed that if he could persuade Jews and Muslims to do the
Art with him, they would become converted to Christianity. For
the Art was based on religious conceptions common to all the three
great religions, and on the elemental structure of the world of
nature universally accepted in the science of the time. Starting
from premisses common to all, the Art would demonstrate the
necessity of the Trinity.
The common religious conceptions were the Names of God,
4

Lull himself never uses the word 'Ideas' of his Divine Names or
Dignities, but the creative Names are identified with Platonic Ideas by
Scotus; see 'R.L. and S.E.', p. 7.
176

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

that God is good, great, eternal, wise, and so on. Such Names of
God belong very strongly into the Christian tradition; many of
them are mentioned by Augustine, and in the De divinibus nominibus of Pseudo Dionysius they are listed at length. The names used
by Scotus Erigena and by Ramon Lull are nearly all to be found in
the book On the Divine Names of Pseudo Dionysius.5
The Names of God are fundamental in Judaism, and particu-larly to the type of Jewish mysticism known as the Cabala.
Spanish Jews contemporary with Lull were meditating with
particular intensity on the Names of God under the influence of
Cabala, the doctrines of which were being propagated in Spain. A
main text of the Cabala, the Zohar was written in Spain in Lull's
time. The Sephiroth of the Cabala are really Divine Names as
creative principles. The sacred Hebrew alphabet is, mystically
speaking, supposed to contain all the Names of God. A form of
Cabalist meditation particularly developed in Spain at this time
consisted in meditating on the letters of the Hebrew alphabet,
combining them and recombining them to form the Names of
God.6
Mohammedanism, particularly in its mystical form, Sufism, also
attaches great importance to meditating on the Names of God. This
had been particularly developed by the Sufi mystic, Mohidin, the
influence of whom on Lull has been suggested.7
All Lull's arts are based on Names or attributes of God, on
concepts such as Bonitas, Magnitudo, Eternitas, Potestas, Sapientia,
Voluntas, Virtus, Veritas, Gloria (Goodness, Greatness, Eternity,
5

See 'R.L. and S.E.', pp. 6 ff.
See G. G. Scholem, Major Trends in fewish Mysticism, Jerusalem,
1941 (second edition, New York, 1942). The Spanish Cabala of Lull's
time had as its basis the ten Sephiroth and the twenty-two letters of the
Hebrew alphabet. The Sephiroth are 'the ten Names most common to
God and in their entirety they form his one great Name' (Scholem, p. 210).
They are 'the creative Names which God called into the world' (Ibid.,
p. 212). The Hebrew alphabet, the other basis of Cabala, also contains the
Names of God. The Spanish Jew, Abraham Abulafia, was contemporary
with Lull and was an adept in the Cabalist science of the combination of
Hebrew letters. These are combined with one another in an endless series
of permutations and combinations which may seem meaningless, but not
to Abulafia who accepts the Cabalist doctrine of divine language as the
substance of reality (Ibid., p. 131).

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

Power, Wisdom, Will, Virtue, Truth, Glory). Lull calls such con-cepts the 'Dignities of God'. Those just listed form the basis of the
'nine' forms of the Art. Other forms of the Art add other Divine
Names or attributes to this list and are based on a greater number
of such Names or Dignities. Lull designates these concepts by his
letter notation. The nine listed above are designated by the letters
BCDEFGHIK.
The basic Divine Names of the Art in all its forms rested it on
religious concepts common to Christianity, Judaism, and Moham-medanism. And the cosmological structure of the Art rested it on
scientific concepts universally accepted. As Thorndike pointed
out,8 the derivation from cosmological 'rotae' of the wheels of the
Art is obvious, and it becomes very apparent when Lull uses the
figures of the Art to do a kind of astrological medicine, as he does in
his Tractatus de astronomia.9 Moreover, the four elements in their
various combinations enter very deeply into the structure of the
Art, even into the kind of geometrical logic which it uses. The
logical square of opposition is identified in Lull's mind with the
square of the elements,10 hence his belief that he has found a
'natural' logic, based on reality11 and therefore greatly superior to
scholastic logic.
How did Lull reconcile the two basic features of his Art, its
religious basis in the Divine Names, and its cosmological or ele-mental basis ? The answer to this question was found when the
influence on Lull of the De divisione naturae of John Scotus
Erigena was detected.12 In Erigena's great Neoplatonic vision,
which is also a Trinitarian and Augustinian vision, the Divine
Names are primordial causes out of which issue directly the four
elements in their simple form as the basic structures of the creation.
Here then, or so I believe, is the major clue to the underlying

suppositions of the Lullian Art. The Divine Dignities form into
triadic structures,13 reflected from them down through the whole
creation; as causes they inform the whole creation through its
elemental structure. An Art based on them constructs a method by
which ascent can be made on the ladder of creation to the Trinity
at its apex.
The Art works on every level of creation, from God, to the
angels, the stars, man, animals, plants, and so on—the ladder of
being as envisaged in the Middle Ages—by abstracting the essential
bonitas, magnitudo, and so on, on each level. The meanings of the
letter notation change in accordance with the level on which the
Art is being used. Let us follow how this works out in the case of
B for Bonitas as it moves down the ladder of creation, or through
the nine 'subjects' listed in the nine-form of the Art as those
with which the Art will deal.
On the level

the different levels of the ladder of being are taken from Lull's

step, and on reaching the summit with Deus, the Intellect enters
the House of Wisdom.
It is fundamental for the approach to the Lullian Art to realise
that it is an ars ascendendi et descendendi. Bearing the geometrical
figures of the Art, inscribed with their letter notations, the
'artista' ascends and descends on the ladder of being, measuring
out the same proportions on each level. The geometry of the
elemental structure of the world of nature combines with the
divine structure of its issue out of the Divine Names to form the
universal Art which can be used on all subjects because the mind
works through it with a logic which is patterned on the universe.
An attractive fourteenth-century miniature (P1. 10) illustrates this
aspect of the Art.
That the divine goodness and other attributes are present on
all the levels of being was a notion having its origins in the Mosaic
account of creation, at the end of the Mays' of which God saw that
His work was good. The idea of the 'Book of Nature' as a road to
God was present in the traditions of Christian mysticism, particu-larly the Franciscan tradition. Lull's peculiarity is the selection of a
certain number of Dignitates Dei and to find these descending in a
precisely calculable manner, almost like chemical ingredients, on
the grades of creation. This notion is however the constant of
Lullism. All the arts are based on such principles; they could be
applied to any subject. And when Lull writes a book on any subject
it begins with the enumeration of B to K in this subject. This
makes for tedium, but it is the root of his claim that he had a
universal Art, infallible for any subject, because based on
reality.
The workings of the Art in its various forms are of a complexity
impossible to suggest here, but the reader must be made familiar
with the appearance of certain basic figures. The three shown are
taken from the Ars brevis, the shortened form of the Ars magna.
The A figure (Fig. 5) shows B to K set out on a wheel and joined
by complex triangulations. This is a mystical figure in which we
meditate on the complex relations of the Names with one another
as they are in the Godhead, before extension into the creation, and
as aspects of the Trinity.
The T figure shows the relata of the Art (differentia, concordia,
contrarietas; principium, medium, finis, majoritas, equalitas, minoritas) set out as triangles within a circle. Through the triangulations
181

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

Fig. 5 'A' Figure. From R. Lull's Ars brevis (Opera, Strasburg, 1617)
of the relata the Trinitarian structure of the Art is maintained on
every level.
The most famous of all the Lullian figures is the combinatory
figure (Fig. 6). The outer circle, inscribed B to K, is stationary and
within it revolve circles similarly inscribed and concentric with it.
As the circles revolve, combinations of the letters B to K can be
read off. Here is the renowned ars combinatoria in its simplest
form.
The Art uses only three geometrical figures, the circle, the tri-angle, and the square, and these have both religious and cosmic
significance. The square is the elements; the circle, the heavens;
and the triangle, the divinity. I base this statement on Lull's
allegory of the Circle, the Square, and the Triangle in the Arbor
scientiae. Circle is defended by Aries and his brothers and by
Saturn and his brothers as the figure most like to God, with no
beginning or end. Square maintains that it is he who is most like
182

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

to God in the four elements. Triangle says that he is nearer to the
soul of man and to God the Trinity than are his brothers Circle
and Square. 14
As already mentioned, the Art was to be used by the three
powers of the soul, one of which is memory. How was the Art as
memoria to be distinguished from the Art as intellectus or as
voluntas. It is not easy to separate the operations of intellect, will,

and memory in the Augustinian rational soul, for they are one, like
the Trinity. Nor is it easy to distinguish these operations in the
Lullian Art, for the same reason. In an allegory in his Book of
Contemplation, Lull personifies the three powers of the soul as
three noble and beautiful damsels standing on top of a high
mountain, and describes their activities thus:
The first remembers that which the second understands and the
third wills; the second understands that which the first remembers
and the third wills; the third wills that which the first remembers
and the second understands.15

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

If the Lullian Art as memory consists in memorising the Art as
intellect and will, then the Lullian Art as memory consists in
memorising the Art as a whole, in all its aspects and operations.
And it is fairly clear from other passages that this was, in fact, what
the Lullian Art as memory did mean.
In the 'Tree of Man' in the Arbor scientiae, Lull analyses
memory, intellect and will, ending the treatment of memory with
the words:
And this treatise of memory which we give here could be used
in an Ars memorativa which could be made in accordance with
what is said here.16
Though the expression Ars memorativa is the familiar term for the
classical art, what Lull proposes to memorise by the proposed
memory treatise is really the principles, terminology, and opera-tions of his Art. This is yet more clearly stated in the trilogy, which
he wrote later, De memoria, De intellectu, and De voluntate. These
three treatises outline the whole paraphernalia of the Art which is
to be used by all the three powers. These three treatises are set out
in the tree form, so characteristic of Lull; the 'Tree of Memory' is a
diagrammatic exposition of the Art, using the familiar nomencla-tures. This Tree of Memory leads us once more to the assumption
that the Lullian Art of Memory would consist in remembering the
Lullian Art. But the Tree of Memory concludes with these words:
We have spoken of memory and given the doctrine for artificial
memory that it may attain its objects artificially.17
Thus Lull can call the memorising of his Art 'artificial memory',
and an Ars memorativa, expressions undoubtedly influenced by the
terminology of the classical art. The memorative side, the memo16

The trilogy is unpublished. The manuscript of the De memoria

this work are made by Paolo Rossi, 'The Legacy of Ramon Lull in Six-teenth-Century Thought', Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies, Warburg
Institute, V (1961), pp. 199–202.
Another 'Tree' work in which there is some discussion of memory is
the Arbre de filosofia desiderat (published in the Palma edition of Lull's
Obres, XVII (1933), ed. S. Galmes, pp. 399–507). This work is also said
by Lull to be a specimen of a projected ars memorativa; again the art of
memory here consists in memorising the procedures of the Art. Cf.
Carreras y Artau, I, pp. 534–9; Rossi, Clavis universalis, pp. 64 ff.
184
17

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

rising of the principles and procedures of the Art, was strongly
insisted on by Lull, and he seems to have thought of the diagrams
of the Art as in some sense 'places'. And there is a classical
precedent for the use of mathematical or geometrical order in
memory of Aristotle's De memoria et reminiscentia, a work which
Lull knew.
That Lullism as 'artificial memory' was the memorising of the
procedures of the Art introduces something new into memory. For
the Art as Intellect was an art of investigation, an art of finding out
truth. It asked 'questions', based on the Aristotelian categories, of
every subject. And although the questions and the answers are
largely pre-determined by the presuppositions of the Art (there
can be only one answer, for example, to the question 'Is God
good ?') yet memory in memorising such procedures is becoming a
method of investigation, and a method of logical investigation.
Here we have a point, and a very important one, in which Lullism
as memory differs fundamentally from the classical art, which
seeks only to memorise what is given.
And what is totally absent from genuine Lullism as artificial
memory is the use of images in the manner of the classical artificial
memory of the rhetoric tradition. The principle of stimulating
memory through the emotional appeal of striking human images
has no place in the Lullian Art as memory, nor do the corporeal
similitudes developed out of the art in the mediaeval transforma-tion of it ever appear in Lull's conception of artificial memory.
What indeed could seem more totally remote from classical
artificial memory, in its contemporary scholastic transformation,
than the Lullian Art as artificial memory ? To reflect in memory
the letter notations moving on the geometrical figures as the
apparatus of Art works up and down the ladder of being would
seem an exercise of an utterly different character from the con-struction of vast memory buildings stored with emotionally
stimulating corporeal similitudes. The Lullian Art works with
abstractions, reducing even the Names of God to B to K. It is more
like a mystical and cosmological geometry and algebra than it is
like the Divine Comedy or the frescoes of Giotto. If it is to be
called 'artificial memory', then it is of a kind which Cicero and the
author of Ad Herennium could not have recognised as descended
from the classical tradition. And in which Albertus Magnus and
Thomas Aquinas could have seen no trace of the places and
185

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

images of the artificial memory recommended by Tullius as a
part of Prudence.
It cannot be said that the great principle of classical artificial

memory, the appeal to the sense of sight, is absent from Lullism,
for memorisation from diagrams, figures, and schematisations is a
kind of visual memory. And there is a point at which Lull's con-ception of places verges rather closely on classical visualisation of
186

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

places, namely in his fondness for diagrams in the form of trees.
The tree, as he uses it, is a kind of place system. The most notable
example of this is the Arbor scientiae in which the whole encyclo-pedia of knowledge is schematised as a forest of trees, the roots of
which are B to K as principles and relata of the Art (Fig. 7). We
even have in this series trees of Heaven and Hell and of virtues
and vices. But there are no 'striking' images of the kind advised in
'Tullian' artificial memory on these trees. Their branches and
leaves are decorated only with abstract formulae and classifica-tions. Like everything else in the Art, virtues and vices work with
the scientific precision of elemental compounds. One of the most
valuable aspects of the Art was, in fact, that doing it made one
virtuous, as vices were 'devicted' by virtues on the analogy of
elemental processes.18
Lullism had a vast diffusion which has only recently begun to be
systematically studied. Owing to the core of Platonism, and of
Scotist Neoplatonism, within it, it formed a current which, not
acceptable to many in the ages dominated by scholasticism, found
itself in a much more welcoming atmosphere at the Renaissance. A
symptom of the popularity which it would gain in the full Renais-sance is the interest accorded to it by Nicholas of Cusa.19 In the
full Neoplatonic stream of the Renaissance, stemming from Ficino
and Pico, Lullism took a place of honour. Renaissance Neoplatonists were able to recognise in it notions very congenial to them
and reaching them from mediaeval sources which, unlike the
humanists, they did not despise as barbarous.
There is even, at the heart of Lullism, a kind of interpretation of
astral influences which would have aroused interest in the age of
Ficino and Pico. When the Art is done on the level coelum, it be-comes a manipulation of the twelve signs of the zodiac and the
seven planets, in combination with B to K, to form a kind of
benevolent astral science, which can be worked as astral medicine,
and which, as Lull points out in the preface to his Tractatus de
astronomia, is a very different matter from ordinary judicial
astrology.20 The Lullian medicine has not yet been adequately

studied. It may conceivably have influenced Ficino.21 It was
certainly taken up by Giordano Bruno, who states it as his belief
that the Paracelsan medicine was largely derived from it.22
Lullism thus establishes itself at the Renaissance as belonging
with the fashionable philosophy, and becomes assimilated to
various aspects of the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition. The relation-ship of Lullism to Cabalism at the Renaissance is particularly
important.
It is my opinion that there was a Cabalist element in Lullism
from the start. So far as I know, the practice of meditating on
combinations of letters was, before Lull, an exclusively Jewish
phenomenon, developed particularly in Spanish Cabala as the
meditation on combinations of the sacred Hebrew alphabet, which,
according to mystical theory, contains symbolically within it the
whole universe and all the Names of God. Lull does not combine
Hebrew letters in his Art, but he combines B to K (or more
letters in Arts based on more Divine Dignities than those used in
the nine form). Since these letters stand for the divine attributes,
or Names of God, he is therefore, it seems to me, adapting a
Cabalist practice to Gentile uses. This would be, of course, a part
of his appeal to the Jews to accept Trinitarian Christianity through
the use of one of their own sacred methods. The question of the
influence of Cabalism on Lull is, however, still undecided, and we
may leave it as an open question, since all that matters here is the
fact that in the Renaissance Lullism was certainly closely
associated with Cabalism.
Pico della Mirandola was, so far as I know, the first to make
explicitly such an association. When discussing Cabala in his
Conclusions and Apology, Pico states that one type of Cabala is an
21

Evidence of the diffusion of Lullism in the vicinity of Ficino has been
published by J. Ruysschaert, 'Nouvelles recherches au sujet de la bibliothèque de Pier Leoni, médecin de Laurent le Magnifique', Académie
Royale de Belgique, Bulletin de la Classe des Lettres et des Sciences Morales
et Politiques, 5e série, XLVI (1960), pp. 37–65. It appears that Lorenzo de'
Medici's doctor had a considerable number of Lull manuscripts in his
library.
22
Bruno's Medicina Lulliana (Op. lat., I l l , pp. 569–633) is based on
Lull's Liber de regionibus sanitatis et infirmitatis, the revolving figure of
which Bruno is working. See 'The Art of R.L.', p. 167. In the preface to
the De lampade combinatoria lulliana (Op. lat., I I , ii, p. 234) Bruno
accuses Paracelsus of having borrowed his medicine from Lull.
188

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

ars combinandi, done with revolving alphabets, and he further states
that this art is like 'that which is called amongst us the ars Raymundi',23 that is, the Art of Ramon, or Raymond Lull. Whether
rightly or wrongly, Pico therefore thought that the Cabalist art of
letter combinations was like Lullism. The Renaissance followed
him in this belief which gave rise to a work entitled the De auditu
kabbalistico, the first editions of which were at Venice in 1518 and
1533.24 This work appears to be, and indeed is, doing the Lullian
Art using the normal Lullian figures. But Lullism is now called
Cabalism and B to K are more or less identified with Cabalist
Sephiroth and associated with Cabalist angel names. Pico's
identification of Cabalist ars combinandi with the ars Raymundi has
borne fruit in work, the authorship of which is attributed to Lull, in
which Lullism has become inextricably associated with Cabalism.
It is now known who was the real author of this work,25 but the
Renaissance firmly believed in its false attribution to Lull.
Renaissance Lullists read the Pseudo-Lullian De auditu kabbalistico
as a genuine work by Lull and it confirmed them in their belief that
Lullism was a kind of Cabalism. In the eyes of Christian Cabalists
it would have the advantage of being a Christian Cabala.
Other works wrongly attributed to Lull were accepted as genuine
in the Renaissance and added to his reputation. These were the
Pseudo-Lullian alchemical works.26
From the early fourteenth century onwards numbers of treatises
on alchemy appear under the name of the great Raymundus
Lullus. Written after his death, these works were certainly not by
Lull himself. So far as is known, Lull never used the Art on the
subject of alchemy, but he did use it on the cognate subject of
astral medicine, and the Art, with its 'elemental' basis, did provide
a method for working with elemental patterns of a similar kind to

those which alchemy uses. The figures of Pseudo-Lullian al-chemical works bear some resemblance to genuine Lullian figures.
For example, in the diagram from a fifteenth-century PseudoLullian alchemical treatise, illustrated in Sherwood Taylor's
book, we see what look like combinatory wheels marked with
letters at the root of a Lullian type of tree diagram; at the top of
the tree are wheels marked with the twelve signs and the seven
planets. An alchemist might possibly have developed this figure
out of what is said about elemental and celestial correspondences
in the matter accompanying the 'Tree of the Elements' and the
'Tree of Heaven' in Lull's Arbor scientiae. Nevertheless, no genuine
Lullian Art uses so many letters as there are on the wheels here.
But disciples of Lull may well have believed that they were
developing Lullism in paths indicated by the Master with their
Pseudo-Lullian alchemy.27 At any rate, the Renaissance certainly
associated Lull with alchemy and accepted the alchemical works
bearing his name as genuinely by him.
So we see the Renaissance Lull building up as a kind of Magus,
versed in the Cabalist and Hermetic sciences cultivated in the
occult tradition. And we find the mysterious language of Renais-sance occultism and magic, speaking of a new light emerging from
darkness and urging a Pythagorean silence, in yet another PseudoLullian work in which Lullism is associated with yet another
Renaissance interest, rhetoric.28
What then will be the position in regard to Lullism and the
classical art of memory of the rhetoric tradition which we have
seen in the last chapter developing into a Renaissance occult
form ? Is Lullism as an art of memory so radically different from
the classical art that any amalgamation of the two is out of the
question ? Or will ways be sought in the Renaissance atmosphere
of fusing two arts both so attractive to those in the Renaissance

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

Hermetic-Cabalist tradition as Lullism and the classical art of
memory ?
There is a short treatise by Lull on memory, not so far mentioned
in this chapter, which is of basic importance in this connection.
This is the Liber ad memoriam confirmandam.29 This very short
work is the nearest thing to an actual 'memory treatise' by Lull that
we have, a treatise giving directions on how to strengthen and
confirm memory. Its concluding words state that it was written 'in
the city of Pisa in the monastery of San Donnino30 by Raymundus
Lullus'. This serves to date it as having been written in about 1308
when Lull was in Pisa. He was now an old man. He had been ship-wrecked off Pisa when returning from his second missionary
journey to North Africa, and in Pisa he completed the last version
of the Art, the Ars generalis ultima, or Ars Magna, and also wrote
the Ars brevis, the abbreviated form of the Art. The Liber ad
memoriam confirmandam, also written in Pisa at this time, therefore
belongs to the period of Lull's life when he was drawing up the Art
in its final forms. It is a perfectly authentic and genuine work by
Lull—we are not dealing here with a Pseudo-Lullian product—
though it is very obscure and the manuscripts may be corrupt in
places.
29
Five manuscripts of the Liber ad memoriam confirmandam are known;
two in Munich (Clm. 10593, f. 1 –4; and ibid., f. 218–221); one in Rome
(Vat. lat. 5347, f. 68–74); one in Milan (Ambrosiana, 1, 153 inf. f. 35–
40); and one in Paris (B. N . Lat. 17820, f. 437–44). I wish here to express
my gratitude to Dr. F. Stegmuller for supplying me with photostats of
the Munich and Vatican manuscripts.
The Liber ad memoriam confirmandam was published by Paolo Rossi in
1960 as an appendix to his Clavis universalis, pp. 261–70. Rossi's text is
not quite satisfactory since he used only three of the manuscripts. How-ever it is very useful that he has made a provisional text available. Rossi
discusses the work in Clavis universalis, pp. 70–4; and in 'The Legacy of
R.L.', pp. 203–6.
On possible echoes of John of Salisbury's Metalogicon in the Liber ad
memoriam confirmandam, see above, p. 56, note 16.
30
All five manuscripts read 'in monasterio sancti Dominici' which is
accepted by Rossi (Clavis, p. 267). It is known however that Lull did not
stay in the Dominican convent at Pisa but in the Cistercian convent of
San Donnino. The oldest manuscripts of works written by Lull at Pisa
have 'S. Donnini' as the house in which they were written, which later
copyists corrupted to 'Dominici'. See J. Tarré, 'Los códices lulianos de la
Biblioteca Nacional de Paris', Analecta Sacra Tarraconensia, XIV (1941),
p. 162. (I am indebted to J. Hillgarth for this reference.)
191

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

Memory, says Lull, has been defined by the ancients as of two
kinds, one natural, the other artificial. He gives a reference as to
where the ancients have made this statement, namely in 'the
chapter on memory'.31 This must be a reference to the memory
section of Ad Herennium. 'Natural memory', he continues, 'is that
which a man receives in creation or generation, and according to
what influence he receives from the reigning planet, according to
which we see that some men have better memories than others.'32
This is an echo of Ad Herennium on natural memory, with the
addition of planetary influences as a factor in natural memory.
'The other kind of memory', he continues, 'is artificial memory
and this is of two kinds.' One consists in the use of medicines and
plasters for the improvement of memory, and these he does not
recommend. The other kind consists in frequently going over in
memory what one wishes to retain, like an ox chewing the cud.
For 'as it is said in the book of memory and reminiscence by
frequent repetition (memory) is firmly confirmed'.33
We have to think this over. This is a memory treatise by Lull
which looks as though it is going to be on classical lines. He must
know what the ancients have said about artificial memory consisting
in places and images, since he refers to the memory section of Ad
Herennium. But he deliberately leaves out the 'Tullian' rules. The
only rule which he gives is taken from Aristotle's De memoria et
reminiscentia on frequent meditation and repetition. This shows
that he knows the scholastic conflation of the rules of Ad Heren-nium with Aristotle on memory, for Lull's one and only rule for
'artificial memory' is Thomas Aquinas' fourth rule, that we should
meditate frequently on what we wish to remember, as Aristotle
advises.34 Lull omits (and one must suppose that by this deliberate

'Venio igitur . . . ad memoriam quae quidem secundum Antiquos in
capite de memoria alia est naturalis alia est artificialis.' Four of the five
manuscripts give the reference 'in capite de memoria' so this should not
be relegated to a footnote as a variant found only in the Paris manuscript
(Rossi, Clavis, pp. 264 and 268, note 126).

statements about this in 'The Legacy of R.L.', p. 205 are confused.

omission, he rejects) the three other rules of Thomas with their
adoption of the rules of Ad Herennium as 'corporeal similitudes'
ranged in order.
It is worth reminding ourselves here that the Dominican
monastery at Pisa (in which Lull was not actually staying, but at
another monastery in Pisa) was to be an active centre in propagat-ing the Thomist artificial memory, now beginning to be diffused
in great strength. Bartolomeo da San Concordio was a Dominican
of Pisa and we have studied in an earlier chapter his propagation of
the 'Ad Herennian' rules conflated with Aristotle in the Thomist
manner.35 It would thus be likely that Lull, whilst in Pisa might have
been confronted with the growing Dominican activity in propagat-ing the mediaeval transformation of artificial memory. This makes
it all the more significant that he so pointedly leaves out of his
definition of artificial memory the use of the striking corporeal
similitudes, so advantageous for remembering virtues and vices
and the roads to Heaven and Hell.
The almost definite opposition to Dominican artificial memory
which one senses in this treatise reminds one of the story told in the
contemporary life of Lull of the alarming vision that he had in a
Dominican church in which a voice told him that only in the Order
of Preachers would he find salvation. But to enter the Order of
Preachers he must abandon his Art. He made the bold decision to
save his Art at the possible expense of his soul 'choosing rather that
he himself should be damned than that his art, whereby many
might be saved, should be lost.'36 Was Lull threatened with
insufficient emphasis on Remembering Hell in his Art which made
no use of striking corporeal similitudes ?
What does Lull teach us to remember in the Liber ad memoriam
confirmandam by his artificial memory which has only one rule, the
Aristotelian rule of constant repetition ? It is the Lullian Art and all
its procedures. The treatise opens with prayers to the divine
Bonitas and other attributes, prayed to in association with the
Virgin Mary and with the Holy Spirit. This is the Art as voluntas,
its direction of the will. And in the rest of the treatise, the pro-cedures of the Art as intellectus are alluded to, its mode of

ascending and descending through the hierarchy of being, its power
of making logical judgments through that part of memory which
Lull calls discretio, through which the contents of memory are
examined to reply to enquiries as to whether things are true or
certain. Once again, we are led to the conviction that Lullian
artificial memory consists in memorising the Lullian Art as voluntas
and as intellectus. And we are further again led to the conviction
that the images or 'corporeal similitudes' of classical memory of the
rhetorical tradition are incompatible with that Lull calls 'artificial
memory'.
In the early sixteenth century, Bernardus de Lavinheta, the
holder of the newly established chair of Lullism at the Sorbonne,
quoted and commented on the Liber ad memoriam confirmandam in
an appendix on memory at the end of his large and influential
compendium on Lullism. He groups things to be remembered into
'sensibilia' and 'intelligibilia'. For remembering the 'sensibilia' he
recommends the classical art, and gives a short account of its
places and images. But for remembering the 'intelligibilia', or
'speculative matters which are far remote not only from the senses
but even from the imagination one must proceed by another
method of remembering. And for this is necessary the Ars generalis
of our Doctor Illuminatus, who collects all things in his places,
comprehending much in little.' This is followed by a brief mention
of the figures, rules, and letters of the Lullian Art.37 By a curious
misuse of the scholastic terminology (in which, of course, 'sensible'
images are used to remember 'intelligible' things), Lavinheta makes
the classical art an inferior discipline used only for remembering
'sensibilia', whilst the higher 'intelligibilia' are to be remembered
by a different Art, that of Lullism. Lavinheta leads us back once
again to the same point. Images and 'corporeal similitudes' are
incompatible with genuine Lullism.
There would seem, therefore, to be no possible point of contact
between Renaissance Lullism, which we have seen to be congenial

to the Renaissance Neoplatonic and occult tradition in many ways,
and the interest of that tradition in the classical art of memory,
developed into occult memory.
There may, however, be a point of contact.
There is a curious feature of Lull's Liber ad memoriam confirmandam which has not yet been mentioned. In that work it is
stated that the person who wants to strengthen his memory must
use another book by the writer which will give him the real clue.
This book is three times referred to as absolutely essential for
memory; it is called 'The Book of the Seven Planets'.38 There is no
work by Lull with this title. The zealous eighteenth-century editor
of Lull's Latin works, Ivo Salzinger, was convinced that he knew
how to explain this mystery. In the first volume of his edition of
Lull's Latin works, the famous Mainz edition, there is a long work
by Salzinger himself entitled 'The Revelation of the Secret of the
Art of Ramon Lull'. In this he quotes at great length from Lull's
Tractatus de Astronomia, giving in full the astral-elemental theory
of that work, and also quotes in full the long passage in it on why
the number of the planets is seven. He then states that this work of
Lull's on 'astronomy' contains, amongst other arcane arts:
38

Near the beginning of the treatise, the reader is told to 'go to the
fifth subject designated by B C D in the book of the seven planets (in
libro septem planetarum) where we treat of miraculous things and you may
gain knowledge of every natural entity'. And in the last paragraph the
reader is twice referred again to the book of the seven planets as contain-ing the whole key to memory (Rossi, Clavis, pp. 262, 266, 267). The three
references to the Liber septem planetarum are in all five of the manuscripts.
Rossi has suggested ('The Legacy of R. Lull', pp. 205–6) that, though
the Liber ad memoriam confirmandam is authentically by Lull, the manu-scripts of it, none of which is earlier than the sixteenth century, may
have been tampered with. If such a possibility is to be considered the
tampering would not consist, in my opinion, in the insertion of references
to the book of the seven planets. References to other books by himself are
a constant feature of Lull's works. It is the specific references to Ad
Herennium and to De memoria et reminiscentia which are a little surpri-sing; it is very unusual for Lull to give references to works other than
his own. It is therefore not out of the question that these specific
references might have been added in a sixteenth-century revision, made
possibly in the circle of Lavinheta. If the specific references are in fact a
late addition, this would not alter the tenor of the work with its obvious
quotations from Ad Herennium and from Aristotle.
195

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

An ars memorandi, 'through which you will retain all the secrets
of this Art disclosed in these seven instruments (the seven pla-nets)'.
He next quotes from the Liber ad memoriam confirmandam (giving
this work explicitly as his source) that for further light on confirm-ing memory we must consult 'The Book of the Seven Planets'.
Salzinger unhesitatingly identifies this book as the Tractatus de
Astronomia.39
If the sixteenth century interpreted the 'Secret of the Art of
Ramon Lull' in a similar manner to Salzinger in the eighteenth
century, it might therefore have found in Lullism the basing of
memory on the celestial 'seven'40 which is the outstanding feature
of Camillo's Theatre.
The Renaissance had other authorities for a celestial basing of
memory (Metrodorus of Scepsis, for example) but if, like Sal-zinger, it believed that it could find in Lullism a confirmation of
that practice, it would not have found in Lullism the use of magic
or talismanic images of the stars in memory. For Lull's avoidance
of images and similitudes is as notable in his astrology, or rather his
astral science, as it is in his attitude to artificial memory. Lull never
uses the images of planets or of the signs, nor refers to all that
array of animal and human images in the constellations of the astro-logical world picture. He does his astral science in a completely
abstract and imageless way, with geometrical figures and letter
notations. Where there might be, however, an element of abstract
or geometrical magic in Lullism would be in thefiguresthemselves;
39
Ivo Salzinger, 'Revelatio Secretorum Artis', in R. Lull, Opera
omnia, Mainz, 1721–42,1, p. 154. Salzinger interprets the 'fifth subject' to
mean the heaven (coelum). Neither the Tractatus de astronomia nor the
Liber ad memoriam confirmandam were published in the Mainz edition
(which was never completed) but Salzinger quotes long extracts from
them in his 'Revelation' and seems to regard them as fundamental for the
Secret.
40
Neither of the two relevant works was available in printed form in
the Renaissance. But Lull manuscripts were circulating. The Liber ad
memoriam confirmandam is quoted by Lavinheta. And practically the
whole of the Tractatus de astronomia, including the passage on why there
are seven planets, is quoted in G. Pirovanus, Defensio astronomiae, Milan,
1507 (see 'R.L. and S.E.', p. 30, note). The Tractatus de astronomia may
thus have helped to swell the chorus of the 'Seven' mystique (see above,
p. 168).

LULLISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

in the square on which the elements move 'quadrangulariter,
circulariter, et triangulariter';41 in the revolving circles reflecting
the spheres of Aries and his brothers, and of Saturn and his
brothers; in the divine triangular patterns.42 Or in the letter
notations themselves which (as in Cabalist use of the Hebrew
alphabet) would have a hieroglyphic as well as a purely notatory
value.
But the proliferation of imagery such as we see in Camillo's
Theatre belongs into a different line of country from Lullism. It
belongs to artificial memory of the rhetoric tradition, with its
images; developed into corporeal similitudes in the Middle Ages;
and developed in the Renaissance Hermetic atmosphere into
astralised and talismanic images. It belongs, in fact, to just that
side of 'artificial memory' which Lull himself excluded.
Nevertheless, it was to be a grand Renaissance aim to bring
together Lullism and the classical art of memory by using magic
images of the stars on the Lullian figures.
Let us enter once more Camillo's Theatre, looking this time for
traces of the Renaissance Lull. Camillo is known to have been
interested in Lullism, and 'Raimundo Lulio' is mentioned in
L'Idea del Theatro, with a quotation from his Testament.43 This is a
Pseudo-Lullian alchemical work. Camillo thus thought of Lull as
an alchemist. When we see the seven planets of the Theatre
extending into the supercelestial world as Sephiroth, we may
wonder whether Camillo also knew the Cabalist Lull of the De
auditu kabbalistico. One feature of the Theatre, the changes in
meaning of the same images on different grades, may remind us of
how B to K takes on different meanings as they move up and down
the ladder of being.
Nevertheless, though the conflation of Lullism with Renaissance
occultised classical memory may be casting the shadow of its
approach on the Theatre, Giulio Camillo still belongs almost

entirely to an earlier phase. The Theatre can be fully explained as
the classical art of memory galvanised into a new and strange life by
Hermetic-Cabalist influences deriving from Ficino's and Pico's
movements. And from the formal point of view the Theatre is
fully classical. Occult memory is still firmly anchored to a building.
Before we can be really convinced that we are seeing Lullism
married to the classical art, we must see the images placed on the
revolving wheels of Lullist figures. Memory may be already
dynamised by magic images in the Theatre; but it is still static
in a building.
We are about to meet the master mind who will place magic
images of the stars on the revolving combinatory wheels of Lullism,
thus achieving the fusion of occultised classical memory with
Lullism for which the world is waiting.

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE
SECRET OF SHADOWS

G

IORDANO Bruno1 was born four years after the death of
Camillo, in 1548. He entered the Dominican Order
in 1563. Trained as a Dominican in the convent in
Naples, that training must have included an intense
concentration on the Dominican art of memory, for the conges-tions, confusions, complications which had grown up around the
'Ad Herennian' precepts in that tradition as we find it in the
treatises of Romberch and Rossellius crowd into Bruno's books on
memory.2 According to words taken down from Bruno's own lips
by the librarian of the Abbey of St. Victor in Paris, he was already
noted as a memory expert before he left the Dominican Order:
Jordanus told me that he was called from Naples to Rome by Pope
Pius V and Cardinal Rebiba, being brought thither in a coach to
show his artificial memory. He recited the psalm Fundamenta in
Hebrew, and taught something of this art to Rebiba.3
There is no means of testing the truth of this vision of Frater
1

This chapter and later chapters on Bruno assume knowledge of my
book Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition in which I analyse the
Hermetic influences on Bruno and show that he belongs into the Renais-sance occult tradition. The book is referred to throughout as G.B. and
H.T.

The pioneer in pointing out the influence of the memory treatises on
Bruno was Felice Tocco, whose pages on this in his Le opere latine di
Giordano Bruno, Florence, 1889, are still valuable.

GIORDANO BRUNO! THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

Jordanus, not yet expelled as a heretic, gloriously transported in a
coach to Rome to display to a pope and a cardinal that speciality
of the Dominicans, the artificial memory.
When Bruno fled from his convent in Naples and began his life
of wanderings through France, England, Germany, he had in his
possession an asset. An ex-friar who was willing to impart the
artificial memory of the friars would arouse interest, and particu-larly if it was the art in its Renaissance or occult form of which he
knew the secret. The first book on memory which Bruno pub-lished, the De umbris idearum (1582) was dedicated to a French
king, Henri III; its opening words promise to reveal a Hermetic
secret. This book is the successor to Camillo's Theatre and Bruno
is another Italian bringing a memory 'secret' to another King of
France.
I gained such a name that the King Henri III summoned me one
day and asked me whether the memory which I had and which I
taught was a natural memory or obtained by magic art; I proved
to him that it was not obtained by magic art but by science. After
that I printed a book on memory entitled De umbris idearum which I
dedicated to His Majesty, whereupon he made me an endowed
reader.4
This is Bruno's own account of his relations with Henri III in his
statement to the Venetian Inquisitors, who had only to look into the
De umbris idearum to recognise at once (being better versed in these
matters than Bruno's nineteenth-century admirers) that it con-tained allusions to the magic statues of the Asclepius and a list of
one hundred and fifty magic images of the stars. Clearly there was
magic in Bruno's art of memory, and a magic of much deeper dye
than Camillo had ventured upon.
When Bruno came over to England, he had fully evolved his
technique of conveying his Hermetic religious message within
the framework of the art of memory, and this was the purport of
the book on memory which he published in England. He continued
these methods in Germany, and the last book which he published
at Frankfort in 1591 immediately before his return to Italy, was on
the magic memory. Ciotto who gave evidence at the Venetian
trial about Bruno's reputation in Frankfort, said that people who
had attended his lessons in the city had told him that 'the said
4

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

Giordano made profession of memory and of having other similar
secrets'. 5
Finally, when Mocenigo invited Bruno to Venice—the invitation
which was the occasion of his return to Italy and which led to his
imprisonment and eventual death at the stake—the reason given
for the invitation was the wish to learn the art of memory.
When I was in Frankfort last year, [stated Bruno to the Venetian
Inquisitors], I had two letters from signor Giovanni Mocenigo, a
Venetian gentleman, who wished, so he wrote, that I should teach
him the art of memory . . . promising to treat me well.6
It was Mocenigo who delated Bruno to the Inquisition in Venice,
presumably when he had learned the full 'secrets' of his art of
memory. They knew a great deal about occult memory in Venice,
owing to the fame of Camillo and his influence in the Venetian
academies.
The art of memory is thus at the very centre of the life and death
of Bruno.
Since I shall often be referring to Bruno's main works on
memory, the titles of some of which are rather cumbrous, I
propose to use abbreviated translations of them, as follows:

Images = De imaginum, signorum et idearum compositione, ad omnia
inventionum, dispositionum et memoriae genera, Frankfort,
1591.11
Of these five works, the first two, Shadows and Circe, belong to
Bruno's first visit to Paris (1581–3); the immensely long Seals
belongs to his period in England (1583–5); Statues and Images
were written during his German period (1586–91).
Three of these works, Shadows, Circe, and Seals, contain 'arts
of memory' which are based on the time worn division of the
memory treatise into 'rules for places' and 'rules for images'. The
treatise in Shadows alters the old terminology calling the locus, the
subjectus, and the image, the adjectus, but the ancient division of
the two aspects of memory training is perfectly perceptible
beneath this new guise, and all the ancient precepts for places
and images, together with many of the elaborations which had
accrued to them in the memory tradition, are present in Bruno's
treatise. The memory treatise in Circe is again on the ancient
pattern, though with changed terminology, and this treatise is
reprinted in Seals. Though the philosophy of the magically
animated imagination which Bruno presents in these treatises is
totally different from the careful Aristotelian rationalisation of the
memory precepts by the scholastics, yet the idea itself of
philosophising the precepts had come down to him in the
Dominican tradition.
Giordano Bruno always professed the greatest admiration for
Thomas Aquinas, and he was proud of the famous art of memory
of his Order. At the beginning of Shadows, there is an argument
between Hermes, Philotheus, and Logifer about the book which
Hermes is presenting, the book about the Shadows of Ideas
containing the Hermetic art of memory. Logifer, the pedant, pro-tests that works like this have been stated to be useless by many
learned doctors.
The most learned theologian and most subde patriarch of letters,
Magister Psicoteus, has stated that nothing of value can be drawn
from the arts of Tullius, Thomas, Albertus, Lullus, and other
obscure authors.12

202

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

Logifer's protests are ignored and the mysterious book offered by
Hermes is opened.
The pedant doctor, 'Magister Psicoteus', has stated the case
against the art of memory, now obsolescent among advanced
humanist scholars and educators.13 The dialogue introducing
Shadowsfitshistorically into place as belonging to the times when
the old art of memory is on the wane. Bruno passionately defends
the mediaeval art of Tullius, Thomas, and Albertus against modern
detractors, but the version of the mediaeval art which he presents
has been through a Renaissance transformation. It has become an
occult art, presented by Hermes Trismegistus.
We may compare this dramatic scene between Hermes, Philotheus (who stands for Bruno himself) and Logifer, the Pedant, in
which the two former defend a Hermetic art of memory, with the
scene in Camillo's Theatre between Viglius-Erasmus and the
inventor of the Hermetic Memory Theatre. The issue is the same;
a Magus is at loggerheads with a rationalist. And just as Camillo
spoke to Viglius of his Theatre as some religious miracle, so
Bruno's Hermetic book on memory is presented as a religious
revelation. The knowledge or art about to be revealed is like a
rising sun before which the creatures of night will vanish. It is
based on the 'unerring intellect' and not on 'fallacious sense'. It is
akin to the insights of 'Egyptian priests'.14
Though the fundamental issue is the same, there are profound
differences in style between the interview in Camillo's Theatre and
Bruno's extraordinary dialogue. Camillo is the polished Venetian
orator presenting a memory system which, though occult in
essence, is ordered and neoclassical in form. Bruno is an ex-friar,
infinitely wild, passionate, and unrestrained as he rushes out of the
mediaevalism of the convent with his art of memory magically
transformed into an inner mystery cult. Bruno comes half a century
later than Camillo and out of a very different environment, not
from civilised Venice but from Naples in the deep south. I do not
think that he was influenced by Camillo, unless in the sense that
the fame of the Theatre in France would have indicated that Kings
of France were open to the reception of memory 'secrets'. Bruno's
version of the Hermetically transformed art of memory was
13

His name suggestive of 'Master Parrot' is perhaps an allusion to the
learning by repetition now preferred to the classical art.

203

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

generated independently from that of Camillo and in quite
different surroundings.
What were those surroundings ? First of all there is the question,
which I shall have to leave unsolved, as to what may, or may not,
have been going on in regard to the art of memory in the Domini-can convent in Naples. The convent was in a state of disorder and
commotion in the late sixteenth century15 and it is not impossible
that some of the excitement might have been due to Renaissance
transformations of the Dominican art of memory.
Thomas Aquinas's memory rules are very carefully framed to
exclude magic, very carefully Aristotelianised and rationalised.
No one who followed Thomas's rules in the spirit in which they
were given could have turned the art of memory into a magical art.
It had become a devotional and an ethical art, a side of it which he
stressed, but the art as he recommended it was certainly not a
magical art. Thomas firmly condemned the Ars notoria,16 the
mediaeval magical art of memory, and his adoption of the memory
rules of 'Tullius' is very cautiously expounded. The subtle dif-ference between his attitude and that of Albertus Magnus to the art
as reminiscence may be due to care in avoiding pitfalls into which
Albertus may have been falling.17
For with Albertus, the position is not so clear. We found some
rather curious things in Albertus on memory, particularly the
transformation of the classical memory image into a huge ram in
the night skies.18 Is it possible that in that Neapolitan convent,
under the impulse of the widespread Renaissance revival of magic,
the art of memory was developing in some Albertist direction, and
may have been using talismanic images of the stars, in which
Albertus was certainly interested ? I can only raise this as a ques-tion, for the whole problem of Albertus Magnus both in the
Middle Ages and in the Renaissance—in which he was widely
studied—is a more or less untrodden field from these points of
view.
We have to remember, too, that Bruno, though he intensely

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SHADOWS

admired Thomas Aquinas, admired him as a Magus, possibly
reflecting a trend in Renaissance Thomism, later developed by
Campanella, which again is a more or less untrodden field of
study.19 There were better grounds for an intense admiration of
Albertus Magnus as a Magus, for Albertus does tend in that direc-tion. When Bruno was arrested, he defended himself for possessing
an incriminating work on magic images on the ground that it was
recommended by Albertus Magnus.20
Leaving the, at present, insoluble problem of what the art of
memory may have been like in the Dominican convent in Naples
when Bruno was an inmate there, let us consider what influences
outside the convent might have been brought to bear on him
before he fled from Naples in 1576, never to return.
In 1560, Giovanni Battista Porta, the famous magician and early
scientist, established in Naples his Academia Secretorum Naturae,
the members of which met at his house to discuss 'secrets', some
magical, some genuinely scientific. In 1558, Porta published the
first version of his great work on Magia naturalis which was to
influence profoundly Francis Bacon and Campanella.21 In this
book, Porta studies the secret virtues of plants and stones and
sets out very fully the system of correspondencies between the
stars and the lower world. Amongst Porta's 'secrets' was his
interest in physiognomics22 concerning which he makes a curious
study of resemblances to animals in human faces. Bruno certainly
knew something of Porta's animal physiognomics which he uses in
his treatment of Circe's magic in Circe, and which can also be
discerned in some of his other works. Porta was also interested in
ciphers, or secret writing,23 which he associates with Egyptian
mysteries, and this again was an interest which Bruno shared.
But what chiefly concerns us here is Porta's Ars reminiscendi, a
19

See G.B. and H.T., pp. 251, 272, 379 ff. In his edition of the works
of Thomas Aquinas, published in 1570, Cardinal Caietano defended the
use of talismans; see Walker, Magic, pp. 214–15, 218–19.

See G.B. and H.T., p. 347.
21
Thorndike has shown (History of Magic and Experimental Science,

mediaeval work, the Secreta Alberti, attributed to Albertus Magnus
though probably not really by him.

treatise on the art of memory published at Naples in 1602.24
Imagination, says Porta, draws images as with a pencil in memory.
There is both natural and artificial memory, the latter invented by
Simonides. Porta regards Virgil's description of the rooms painted
with pictures which Dido showed to Aeneas as really Dido's
memory system, by which she remembered the history of her
ancestors. Architectural places are palaces or theatres. Mathemati-cal precepts and geometrical figures can also be used as places on
account of their order, as described by Aristotle. Human figures
should be used as memory images, chosen for being striking in
some way, very beautiful or very ridiculous. It is useful to take
pictures by good artists as memory images for these are more
striking and move more than pictures by ordinary painters. For
example, pictures by Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, stay in
memory. Hieroglyphs of the Egyptians may be used as memory
images. There are also images for letters and numbers (referring
to the visual alphabets).
Porta's memory is remarkable for its high aesthetic quality, but
his is a normal type of memory treatise, in the scholastic tradition
based on Tullius and Aristotle, with the usual repetitions of the
rules and the usual complications such as visual alphabets. We
might be reading Romberch or Rossellius, except that there is
nothing about remembering Hell and Heaven. There is no overt
magic in the book, so far as I can see, and he condemns Metrodorus of Scepsis for using the stars in memory. The little work
shows, however, that the occult philosopher of Naples was
interested in the artificial memory.
One of the main sources of Bruno's magic was Cornelius
Agrippa's De philosophia occulta (1533). Agrippa does not mention
the art of memory in this work, but in his De vanitate scientiarum
(1530) he has a chapter on it in which he condemns it as a vain art.25
But Agrippa in that work condemns all the occult arts which three
years later he was to expound in his De occulta philosophia, the
most important Renaissance text book on Hermetic and Cabalist
magic. Various attempts have been made to explain Agrippa's
24
This was the Latin version of L'arte del ricordare which Porta had
published at Naples in 1566. It has been suggested (by Louise G. Clubb,
Giambattista Delia Porta Dramatist, Princeton, 1965, p. 14) that Porta
aims at providing mnemonics for actors.

SHADOWS

contradictory attitudes in these two books, one of the most convinc-ing being that the De vanitate scientiarum was a safety device of a
kind frequently employed by writers on dangerous subjects. To be
able to point to a book against magic would be a protection if the
De occulta philosophia got him into trouble. This may not be the
whole explanation but it makes possible the view that the sciences
which Agrippa calls Vain' in his attack on the vanity of sciences
may be those in which he was really interested. Most occult
philosophers of the Renaissance were interested in the art of
memory and it would be surprising if Agrippa were an exception.
At any rate, it was from Agrippa's manual of magic that Bruno
took the magic images of the stars which he used in the memory
system in Shadows.
When Bruno's Shadows was published in Paris in 1582, the work
would not have appeared so utterly strange to the contemporary
French reader as it does to us. He would have been able to place it
at once as belonging into certain contemporary trends. Here was a
book on memory presented as a Hermetic secret and obviously full
of magic. Seized with dread or disapproval, some readers would
have discarded the book. Others, steeped in the prevalent Neoplatonism with its magical fringe, would have sought to discover
whether this new memory expert had carried further the effort to
bring the art of memory into line with the occult philosophy to
which Giulio Camillo had devoted his life. Dedicated to Henri III,
Shadows was clearly in line of descent from the Hermetic Memory
Theatre which Camillo had presented to the present King's
grandfather, Francis I.
The Theatre was not yet forgotten in France. A centre of occult-ist influence in Paris was formed by Jacques Gohorry who started
a kind of medico-magical academy not far from the site of Baif's
Academy of Poetry and Music.26 Gohorry, who was saturated with
Ficinian and Paracelsist influences wrote, under the name of 'Leo
Suavius', a number of extremely obscure works; in one of these,
published in 1550, Gohorry gives a brief description of the
'wooden amphitheatre' which Camillo had constructed for
Francis I. 27 Though Gohorry's academy or group seems to
disappear about 1576, its influences probably continued, and these

would have included some knowledge of occult memory and of
Camillo's Theatre about which Gohorry had written in admiring
terms. Moreover, only four years before the publication of
Bruno's book, Camillo's name had appeared in the Peplus Italiae,
published in Paris, as a famous Italian, along with Pico della
Mirandola and other great Renaissance names.28
In the later sixteenth century, the occult tradition had been
growing in daring. Jacques Gohorry was one of those who thought
that Ficino and Pico had been too timid in putting into practice
mysteries in the writings of Zoroaster, Trismegistus, and other
ancient sages which they knew, and had not made sufficient use of
'images and seals'. Their failure to make full use of their knowledge
of such matters meant, thinks Gohorry, that they failed to be-come wonder-working Magi. Bruno's memory systems show
marked progress in these directions. As compared with Camillo, he
was infinitely more daring in the use of notoriously magical
images and signs in the occult memory. In Shadows he does not
hesitate to use the (supposedly) very powerful images of the
decans of the zodiac; in Circe he introduces the art of memory
with fiercely magical incantations uttered by the sorceress.29
Bruno aimed at very much greater powers than the mild liontaming or the planetary oratory of Camillo.
The reader of Shadows immediately notices the several times
repeated figure of a circle marked with thirty letters. In some of
these figures, concentric circles, marked with the thirty letters,
are shown (Fig. 8). Paris in the sixteenth century was the foremost
European centre of Lullism, and no Parisian could have failed to
recognise these circles as the famous combinatory wheels of the
Lullian Art.
The efforts towards finding a way of conciliating the classical
art of memory, with its places and images, and Lullism with its
movingfiguresand letters, had continued to grow in strength in the
later sixteenth century. The problem must have excited a good
deal of general interest, comparable to the popular interest in the
mind machines of today. Garzoni in his popular work the Piazza
universale (1578), to which I have already more than once referred,

states that it is his ambition to produce a universal memory system
combining Rossellius and Lull.30 If an outsider and a layman, like
Garzoni, hoped to do such a thing, using the published text-book
on memory by Rossellius, the Dominican, how much more might
an insider like Giordano Bruno be expected to produce the uni-

versal memory machine. Trained as a Dominican, expert as a
Lullist, surely here was the great specialist who might finally
solve the problem.
We should expect to find that Bruno's Lull would be the
Renaissance Lull, not the mediaeval Lull. His Lullian circle has
more letters on it than in any genuine Lullian art, and a few Greek
and Hebrew letters, which are never used in genuine Lullism.
His wheel is closer to those to be seen in Pseudo-Lullian al-chemical diagrams which also use some letters other than those of
the Latin alphabet. And when listing Lull's works, Bruno
includes the De auditu kabbalistico as one of them.31 These
indications suggest that Lull, the alchemist, and Lull, the Cabalist,
would come into Bruno's idea of Lullism. But Bruno's Lull is
even more peculiar, and more remote from the mediaeval Lull,
than in normal Renaissance Lullism. He told the librarian of

the Abbey of St. Victor that he understood Lullism better than
Lull himself had done,32 and there is certainly very much to appal
the genuine Lullist in Bruno's use of the art.
Why does Bruno divide his Lullian wheels into thirty segments ?
He was certainly thinking along lines of Names or attributes, for he
lectured in Paris (these lectures are not extant) on 'thirty divine
attributes.'33 Bruno was obsessed with the number thirty. Not
only is this the basic number in Shadows, but there are thirty
seals in Seals, thirty statues in Statues, and thirty 'links' in his work
on how to establish links with demons.34 The only passage in his
books, so far as I know, in which he discusses his use of 'thirty' is in
the De compendiosa architectura artis Lullii, published in Paris in
the same year as Shadows and Circe. Here after listing some of the
Lullian Dignities, Bonitas, Magnitudo, Veritas, and so on, Bruno
assimilates these to the Sephiroth of the Cabala:
All these (i.e. the Lullian Dignities), the Jewish Cabalists reduce
to ten sephiroth and we to thirty . . .35
He thus thought of the 'thirty' on which he based his arts as
Lullian Dignities but Cabalised as Sephiroth. In this passage he
rejects Lull's Christian and Trinitarian use of his Art. The divine
Dignities, he says, really represent the four-lettered Name of God
(the Tetragrammaton) which the Cabalists assimilate to the four
cardinal points of the world and thence by successive multiplica-tion to the whole universe.
It is not quite clear how he arrives at thirty out of this,36 though
this number seems to have been particularly associated with magic.
A Greek magical papyrus of the fourth century gives a thirty32

T h e multiplication of the four-lettered Name should proceed by
multiples of four and twelve, which series nowhere gives a thirty. There

lettered Name of God. Irenaeus when thundering against
gnostic heresies mentions that John the Baptist was supposed to
have thirty disciples, a number suggestive of the thirty aeons of the
gnostics. Still more suggestive of deep magic, the number thirty was
associated with Simon Magus.38 I am inclined to think that
Bruno's actual source was probably the Steganographia of Trithemius in which thirty-one spirits are listed, with recipes for conjur-ing them. In an abstract of this work later made for Bruno, the list
becomes a thirty. Amongst Bruno's contemporaries, John Dee was
interested in the magical value of thirty. Dee's Clavis angelicae was
published at Cracow in 158439 (two years after Bruno's Shadows by
which, therefore, it could have been influenced). The Angelic Key
describes how to conjure 'thirty good orders of the princes of the
air' who rule over all the parts of the world. Dee sets out thirty
magical names on thirty concentric circles and is engaged in magic
for conjuring angels or demons.
Bruno several times mentions in Shadows a work of his called
Clavis magna, which either never existed or has not survived. The
Great Key might have explained how to use Lullian wheels as
conjuring for summoning the spirits of the air. For that is, I
believe, a secret of the use of the Lullian wheels in Shadows. Just as
he converts the images of the classical art of memory into magical
images of the stars to be used for reaching the celestial world, so
the Lullian wheels are turned into 'practical Cabala', or conjuring
for reaching the demons, or angels, beyond the stars.
Bruno's brilliant achievement in finding a way of combining the
classical art of memory with Lullism thus rested on an extreme
'occultising' of both the classical art and of Lullism. He put the
images of the classical art on the Lullian combinatory wheels, but
the images were magic images and the wheels were conjuring
wheels.
In the world in which it was first published, Shadows would have

SHADOWS

fitted into certain well-known patterns. But it does not follow from
this that it would have excited no surprise. On the contrary, just
because the contemporary reader would recognise the kind of thing
that Bruno was attempting, he would also recognise his wild
abandonment of all safeguards and restraints. Here was a man who
would stop at nothing, who would use every magical procedure
however dangerous and forbidden, to achieve that organisation of
the psyche from above, through contact with the cosmic powers,
which had been the dream of the decorous and orderly Camillo,
but which Giordano Bruno pursues with a much more alarming
boldness and with methods infinitely more complex.
What is this curious looking object (P1. II) upon which the
reader is now invited to direct his gaze ? Is it some disc or papyrus
of incredible antiquity dug up in the sands of Egypt ? No. It is my
attempt to excavate the 'secret' of Shadows.
Here are concentric wheels divided into thirty main segments,
each of which is again subdivided into five, giving 150 divisions in
all. On all these divisions there are inscriptions which will, I am
afraid, hardly be legible. This does not matter for we shall never
understand this thing in detail. The plan is only intended to give
some idea of the general lay-out of the system, and also some idea
of its appalling complexity.
How have I arrived at this, and why has this object never been
seen before ? It is quite simple. No one has realised that the lists of
images given in the book, each list consisting of 150 images in sets
of thirty are intended to be set out on concentric wheels, like those
which are several times illustrated (see Fig. 8). These wheels,
intended to revolve in the Lullian manner to give the combina-tions, are marked with the letters A to Z, followed by some Greek
and Hebrew letters, making thirty letter markings in all. The lists
of images given in the book are marked off in thirty divisions
marked with these letters, each division having five subdivisions
marked with the five vowels. These lists, each of 150 images, are
therefore intended to be set out on the concentric revolving wheels.
Which is what I have done on the plan, by writing out the lists of
images on concentric wheels divided into thirty segments with five
subdivisions in each. The result is the ancient Egyptian looking
object, evidently highly magical, for the images on the central
wheel are the images of the decans of the zodiac, images of the
212

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

planets, images of the mansions of the moon, and images of the
houses of the horoscope.
The descriptions of these images are written out from Bruno's
text on the central wheel of the plan. This heavily inscribed central
wheel is the astral power station, as it were, which works the whole
system.
I reproduce here (from the 1886 edition of Shadows) the first
two pages of Bruno's list of astral images to be placed on the central
wheel of the system. The first page (P1. 12a) is headed 'The images
of the faces of the signs from Teucer the Babylonian which can be
used in the present art.' It shows a cut of the sign Aries, and gives
descriptions of images of the first, second, and third 'faces' of
Aries, that is images of the three decans of this sign. On the next
page (P1. 12b) are Taurus and Gemini, each with their three decan
images. It will be noticed that the images have beside them the
letter A followed by five vowels (Aa, Ae, Ai, Ao, Au); then B with
five vowels. The whole of the rest of the list is similarly marked
with the thirty letters of the wheel, each with the five vowel
subdivisions. And all the other lists are marked in a similar way. It
is these markings which give the clue that the lists of images are to
be set out on concentric wheels.
Confining ourselves to the three signs on the pages of the text
here reproduced, the images described for the decans of Aries are
(1) a huge dark man with burning eyes, dressed in white; (2) a
woman; (3) a man holding a sphere and a staff. Those for Taurus
are (1) a man ploughing (2) a man bearing a key (3) a man holding a
serpent and a spear. Those for Gemini are (1) a serving man holding
a rod; (2) a man digging, and a flute-player, (3) a man with a flute.
These images derive from ancient Egyptian star-lore and starmagic.40 The three hundred and sixty degrees of the zodiacal circle
are divided amongst the twelve signs of the zodiac, each of which is
subdivided into three 'faces' of ten degrees each. These latter are
the 'decans' each of which has an image associated with it. The
images of the decans go back to ancient Egyptian sidereal gods of
time; the lists of them were preserved in the archives of Egyptian
temples whence they passed into the lore of late antique astral
40

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

magic, handed down in texts the authorship of which is often
assigned to 'Hermes Trismegistus' who is particularly associated
with the decan images and their magic. These images vary in
different sources, but we do not have to search remote and difficult
texts to find the source of the decan images which Bruno is using.
Bruno used easily accessible printed sources for most of his magic,
relying chiefly on the De occulta philosophia of Henry Cornelius
Agrippa. Agrippa introduces his list of the images of the decans with
the words, 'There are in the zodiac thirty-six images . . . of which
Teucer the Babylonian wrote.' Bruno copied this heading for the
beginning of his list of decan images, which he took, with sometimes
some very slight variations, from the list given by Agrippa.41
After the thirty-six images of the decans there follow, in the list
of star-images in Shadows, forty-nine images of the planets, seven
for each planet. Each group of seven images is headed by a con-ventional cut of the planet concerned. Examples of these planet
images are:
First image of Saturn: A man with a stag's head on a dragon, with
an owl which is eating a snake in his right hand.
Third image of Sol: A young man, diademed, from whose head
spring rays of light, holding a bow and quiver.
First image of Mercury: A beautiful young man with a sceptre, on
which two serpents opposed to one another are entwined with
their heads facing one another.
First image of Luna: A horned woman riding on a dolphin; in her
right hand a chameleon, in her left a lily.
As can be seen, such images express the planetary gods and their
influences, after the manner of planetary talismans. Bruno derived
most of the forty-nine from the list of planet images in Agrippa's
De occulta philosophia.42
Next follow, in Bruno's list, the image of the Draco lunae together
with images of the twenty-eight mansions of the moon, that is of
the stations of the moon on each day of the month. These images
express the rôle of the moon and her movements in passing on the
zodiacal and planetary influences. These images, again, Bruno drew
with only slight variations from Agrippa's De occulta philosophia.43

214

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SHADOWS

We have to see all these astral images in the context of the De
occulta philosophia to realise what Bruno is trying to do. In Agrippa's text-book of magic, such image-lists occur in the second book,
the one on celestial magic which is concerned with operating on
the middle world of the stars—middle as compared with the lower
elemental world dealt with in the first book, and the supercelestial world to which the third book is devoted. One of the chief
ways of operating (according to this kind of magical thought) with
the celestial world is through the magic or talismanic images of the
stars. Bruno is transferring such operations within, applying them
to memory by using the celestial images as memory images, as it
were harnessing the inner world of the imagination to the stars,
or reproducing the celestial world within.
Finally, following a cut representing the twelve houses into
which a horoscope is divided, Bruno gives a list of thirty-six images,
three for each of the twelve houses. These images are expressive
of the aspects of life with which the houses of a horoscope are
supposed to be connected—birth, wealth, brothers, parents,
children, sickness, marriage, death, religion, reign, benefactions,
imprisonment. They are faintly connected with traditional images
of the houses, such as can be seen, for example, in a calendar of
1515,44 but Bruno has strangely varied and added to these to pro-duce a very eccentric list of images which are probably largely of
his own invention. We see him here at the work of 'composing'
magic images on which he was later to write a whole book.
Such then, are the 150 images imprinted on the central wheel of
the magic memory. The whole sky with all its complex astrological
influences was on this wheel. The images of the stars formed
combinations and convolutions as the wheels revolved. And the
master mind who had the sky and all its movements and influences
magically imprinted on memory through magic images was indeed
in possession of a 'secret' worth knowing!
In the introductory pages of Shadows, the art of memory about
to be revealed is presented as a Hermetic secret; it is said to be
actually by Hermes who hands a book containing it to the philo-sopher.45 Moreover the title, De umbris idearum, is taken from a
magical work, Cecco d'Ascoli's necromantic commentary on the

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

Sphere of Sacrobosco in which a Liber de umbris idearum is men-tioned.46 What then are the magical 'shadows of ideas' which are to
be the basis of the Hermetic memory system ?
Bruno's mind is working on lines which are extremely difficult
for a modern to recapture—the lines which Ficino's mind is also
following in his De vita coelitus comparanda—that the images of the
stars are intermediaries between the ideas in the supercelestial
world and the sub-celestial elemental world. By arranging or
manipulating or using the star-images one is manipulating forms
which are a stage nearer to reality than the objects in the inferior
world, all of which depend on the stellar influences. One can
act on the inferior world, change the stellar influences on it, if one
knows how to arrange and manipulate the star-images. In fact the
star-images are the 'shadows of ideas', shadows of reality which are
nearer to reality than the physical shadows in the lower world.
Once one grasps this (to the modern, fundamentally ungraspable)
point of view, many mysteries in Shadows are cleared up. The
book which Hermes hands to the philosopher is the book 'on the
shadows of ideas contracted for inner writing',47 that is to say it
contains a list of magic images of the stars to be imprinted on
memory. They are to be used on revolving wheels:
As the ideas are the principal forms of things, according to which
all is formed... so we should form in us the shadows of ideas . . . so
that they may be adaptable to all possible formations. We form
them in us, as in the revolution of wheels. If you know any other
way, try it.48
By imprinting on memory the images of the 'superior agents', we
shall know the things below from above; the lower things will
arrange themselves in memory once we have arranged there the
images of the higher things, which contain the reality of the lower
things in a higher form, a form nearer to ultimate reality.
The forms of deformed animals are beautiful in heaven. Nonluminous metals shine in their planets. Neither man, nor animals,
nor metals are here as they are there... illuminating, vivifying,
uniting, conforming yourself to the superior agents, you will
advance in the conception and retention of the species.49

How is the adept to conform to the superior agents ? By inwardly
conforming himself to the astral images, through which the indi-vidual species in the lower world will be united. Such an astral
memory will give not only knowledge, but powers:
There is in your primordial nature a chaos of elements and num-bers, yet not without order and series . . . There are, as you may
see, certain distinct intervals . . . On one the figure of Aries is
imprinted; on another, Taurus, and so on for the rest (of the signs
of the zodiac)... This is to form the inform chaos . . . It is neces-sary for the control of memory that the numbers and elements
should be disposed in order . . . through certain memorable forms
(the images of the zodiac)... I tell you that if you contemplate this
attentively you will be able to reach such afigurativeart that it will
help not only the memory but also all the powers of the soul in a
wonderful manner.50
What does this remind us of? Surely of the memory system of
Metrodorus of Scepsis who used the zodiac, and probably the
images of the decans, as his memory place system. The Metrodorian system has turned into a magical system. In relation to the
fundamental zodiacal images, the planet images, moon station
images, houses of the horoscope images of Bruno's list of magic
images, move on the wheels of memory, forming and reforming
the patterns of the universe from a celestial level. And the power
to do this depends on the Hermetic philosophy, that man is in his
origin divine, and organically related to the star-governors of the
world. In 'your primordial nature' the archetypal images exist in a
confused chaos; the magic memory draws them out of chaos and
restores their order, gives back to man his divine powers.
Surrounding the innermost circle or wheel of the star images—
the central power station of the magically animated memory—the
reader will perceive on the plan other circles or wheels all inscribed
with 150 items divided into groups of thirty. Again, I am carefully
carrying out Bruno's instructions, for, as well as the list of 150
star images, he gives three other lists of 150 items each, all marked
with the lettering of the thirty divisions of the wheels and sub-divided into fives, marked with the vowels. Clearly these other
three lists are also to be set out on wheels, concentric with the
star-images wheel.

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SHADOWS

On the wheel immediately surrounding the star-images wheel on
the plan are inscribed the items in the list which begins as follows:
Aa Oliua; Ae Laurus; Ai Myrthus; Ao Rosmarinum; Au
Cypressus51 As can be seen, these all belong to the vegetable
world. There are also birds in this list; animals; stones and metals;
artefacts and other objects, strangely jumbled and including even
sacred objects (am, septem candelabra). Roughly speaking it seems
to represent the vegetable, animal, and mineral worlds, but also
includes fabricated objects, though this classification perhaps
makes rather too much sense of the extraordinary medley. The
idea is, I believe, to represent on this wheel the inferior levels of
creation, vegetable, animal, mineral, moving in dependence on the
celestial wheel.
On the next wheel on the plan (the third from the centre) is
inscribed the list which begins:
Aa nodosum; Ae mentitum; Ai inuolutum; Ao informe; Au
famosum.52 These are all adjectives (knotty, counterfeited,
involved, formless, famous). Why given in the accusative case I
cannot explain, still less explain the extraordinary selection of the
150 adjectives in this list.
Finally, on the outermost wheels of the plan, are inscribed the
150 items of the list which begins:
Aa
Ae
Ai
Ao
Au

Rhegima
Osiris
Ceres
Triptolemus
Pitumnus

panem castanearum
in agriculturam
in iuga bouum
serit

Translated, this means: 'Rhegima (the inventor of) bread from
chestnuts; Osiris (the inventor of) agriculture; Ceres (the inventor
of) yokes for oxen; Triptolemus (the inventor of) sowing; Pitumnus
(the inventor of) manuring.'
On the plan, I show the name of the inventor on the outermost
wheel, and the description of the invention on the wheel immedia-tely adjoining it. The reader may be able to follow this series on the
plan. The five quoted above will be found starting at the middle
of the lower half of the outermost wheel.
No student of Giordano Bruno has ever investigated this list;
still less has anyone realised that these images of human figures are

to be placed on the outer wheel of a memory system organised and
magically animated by the star images on the central wheel. In
my opinion, this list is worthy of close attention. In what follows I
shall try to give an impression, without full quotation of every name
and the invention associated with it, of the extraordinary proces-sion which revolves before us on this wheel.
Following the agricultural group, quoted above, come inventors
of primitive instruments and procedures. Erichtonius invented the
chariot; Pyrodes, drawing fire from flint. Inventors of viticulture
include Noah; Isis first ordered gardens; Minerva showed the use
of oil; Aristeus discovered honey. Next appear inventors of trap-ping, hunting, fishing. Then a group containing such little-known
characters as Sargum, inventor of the basket, Doxius, of building
with clay. Among inventors of tools are Talus, of the saw, Parug,
of the hammer. Next come pottery, spinning, weaving, cobbling,
with Choraebus as the potter. Various strangely named inventors
of—to select a few examples—carding, shoes, glass, pincers,
shaving, combs, carpets, and boats now pass before us. 54
Now that the inventors of the fundamental technologies of
advancing civilisation have been represented, the revolution of the
wheel begins to show us other kinds of human activities. I quote in
full the M and N groups:
Ma
Me
Mi
Mo
Mu
Na
Ne
Ni
No
Nu

Chiron
Circe
Pharphacon
Aiguam
Hostanes
Zoroaster
Suah
Chaldaeus
Attalus
Prometheus

surgery
fascination
necromancy
circles
linking with demons
magic
chiromancy
pyromancy
hydromancy
sacrificing bulls55

What a glittering vision of the inventors of the magical and
demonic arts! Here is Circe, the sorceress—always to be a dominat-ing figure in Bruno's imagination—making her first appearance
in his works. Here is the inventor of 'linking with demons', a
subject later to be treated by Bruno under thirty headings. Here is
Zoroaster, supreme in magic.

219

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

But why does this group end with 'sacrificing bulls' ? It seems to
be a principle of the groups of five that the first figure in them
links with the preceding group, whilst the last figure links with
subjects which are to follow. The hint of religious sacrifice in
Prometheus prepares us for the religious leaders and inventors in
the O, P, and Q groups now about to rise before us in the revolution of the wheel. These include Abel, who sacrificed the flocks;
Abraham who invented circumcision; John the Baptist who
baptised; Orpheus who invented the orgies; Belus who invented
idols; Chemis who invented burial in pyramids. Thus Old Testament figures, and one New Testament figure, appear in the weird
procession.56
After magic and religion—indissolubly linked together and seen
as one—we reach the magician inventors of the visual and musical
arts.
Ra
Re
Ri

Ru

Mirchanes
Giges
Marsias
Tubal

wax figures

the lyre

Other inventors of musical instruments follow in the next group
and then we are led on, through Neptune, tamer of horses, to
equestrian exercises and inventors connected with military art.
Then comes a basic invention:
Xe Theut
inventor of writing with letters58
Here is Thoth-Hermes as the inventor of writing. After the
Egyptian sage we pass on to astronomy, astrology, and philosophy, to Thales and Pythagoras, to a strange mixture of names
and notions:

on the innumerable worlds
on the ideas and from the ideas (in ideas et ab

on the nine elements59

In this collection we have one of the greatest astronomers of
antiquity, Hipparchus; we have the model of the heavens made by
Archimedes; we have 'innumerable worlds', here said to have been
invented by Xenophanes; we have Plato on the ideas. And finally
we have Raymundus Lullus and his Art, based on nine letters or
elements.
This revolution of the wheel of memory is perhaps the most
revealing of them all. The innumerable worlds, which were to be so
prominent a feature of Bruno's philosophy, are here mentioned by
him for the first time. And that the procession of the inventors
through magic and magical religion to philosophy and Lullism
has brought us into the range of Bruno's own interests, and the
weird contexts in which he saw those interests, is emphasised by
the first figure in the group (marked with a Greek letter) which
immediately follows the Z group:
Ior. in clauim & umbras60
This may seem inexplicable at first sight but it is easily explained.
Bruno constantly refers in Shadows to a book by himself, the Clavis
magna, which is not extant. The inventor of the 'key' and of the
'shadows' is Iordanus Brunus, abbreviated as 'lor.', author of the
Clavis magna and of the De umbris idearum. He puts the image of
himself on the wheel, for has he not himself produced a very great
invention ? He has found out the way to use the 'shadows of ideas'
on the Lullian wheels!
After this climax, the reader may feel inclined to sit back and
rest. But we must follow the wheel to the end, though with only a
very few selections from the last names.61 Here is Euclid; also
Epicurus characterised by 'liberty of soul'; also Philolaus who
explained 'the harmony implicit in things (and is constantly
referred to in Bruno's works as a precursor of Copernicus); also
Anaxagoras, another of Bruno's favourite philosophers. And at
last we reach the last name, the last of the 150 inventors and great

men whose images revolve on the wheel of memory. It is
this:
Melicus in memoriam62
(The reader may pick out the name on the plan, to the left of
'Rhegima' with which we started.) Melicus is Simonides, the
inventor of the classical art of memory. How fitting that Simonides
should end the procession, that the revolving wheel should come
back to its beginning with this name! For in all the long history of
the art of memory surely no more extraordinary manifestation of
the tradition can have existed than the memory system which we
have excavated from Shadows.63
Bruno was drawing heavily on Polydore Vergil's De inventoribus
rerum (1499) for his inventors and many of his names are tradi-tional ones. On the other hand, many of them are very strange and
I have not been able to trace them all. The predominance of
barbaric and magical names gives a curiously archaic character
to the list. The inventors' wheel shows us—through the presenta-tion of the whole history of human civilisation—the interests, the
attitudes, the inner mind of Bruno himself. The stress on magic of
all kinds, the inclusion of the names of'demonic' magicians, shows
that this is the memory of an extreme magician. The daring blend
of magic with religion as the religious rites and sacrifices appear on
the wheel shows us the magician who believed in magical religion,
who will advocate the revival of the magical religion of the
Egyptians.64 And as the wheel turns to philosophy, astronomy, to
'innumerable worlds' we realise how all these major interests of
Bruno's blend in the magician's mind. There is a kind of rationa-lism in extremes of magic, and the procession of the inventors,
ranging from technology through magic and religion to philosophy,
presents a curiously modern history of civilisation.
62

Ibid., loc. cit.
There is yet another images list in Shadows, of thirty mythological
images beginning with Lycaon and ending with Glaucus (pp. 107–8).
These figures are lettered with the thirty divisions of the wheels, and are
to be revolved on wheels, but there are only thirty of them, not 150 as in
the lists in the main system. I therefore suppose that they constitute a
separate system, resembling the Thirty Statues of Statues (see below,
pp. 292–3).
64
See G.B. and H.T. for Bruno's belief in 'Egyptian' or Hermetic
religion.
63

222

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

From the memory point of view, these images belong into the
same ancient tradition as that which places notable practitioners
of the arts and sciences on the fresco of the Chapter House of
Santa Maria Novella (P1. I), and which causes Rossellius to 'place'
Plato and Aristotle for Theology and Philosophy.65 Bruno's list of
images of inventors to be used as memory images is in itself—how-ever strange his use of the tradition—absolutely within the
orthodox tradition of the classical art. In placing all these striking
and active images of notable personages on the wheel, Bruno is
pursuing his aim of combining the classical art of memory with
Lullism. The revolving wheels of the Lullian Art have become the
places for the reception of the images.
The most potent of the images in the system are the magic
images on the central wheel. In the Ars memoriae which is included
in the book, and which follows the traditional 'Ad Herennian'
pattern in its discussion of places and images, Bruno discusses
various kinds of memory images, which he regards as having
different degrees of potency, some being nearer to reality than
others. Those with the highest degree of potency, which are least
opaque to reality, he calls 'sigilli'.66 In such passages, he is, I
believe, explaining his use of 150 such 'sigilli', or magic seals, or
astral images, in the memory system.
How did the system work ? By magic, of course, by being based
on the central power station of the 'sigilli', the images of the stars,
closer to reality than the images of things in the sublunar world,
transmitters of the astral forces, the 'shadows' intermediary
between the ideal world above the stars,67 and the objects and
events in the lower world.
But it is not enough to say vaguely that the memory wheels
worked by magic. It was a highly systematised magic. Systematisation is one of the key-notes of Bruno's mind; there is a compulsion
towards systems and systematisation in the magic mnemonics
65

See above, p. 164.
'Signs, Notae, Characters, and Seals' all have this high degree of
potency; Bruno refers for further information to the missing Clavis
Magna (Op. lat., II (i), p. 62).
67
Near the beginning of the Ars memoriae, he says that the eternal
ideas are received 'as an influx through the medium of the stars' (Ibid.,
p. 58). The passage is redolent of Ficino in the De vita coelitus comparanda.
223
66

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

which drives their designer throughout his life to a perpetual
search for the right system. My plan does not represent the full
complexity of this system, in which the five subdivisions revolve
independently within the thirty compartments of the wheels.68
Thus the images of decans of the zodiac, the images of the planets,
the images of the moon-stations would form and reform in ever
changing combinations, in connection with the images of the
houses. Did he intend that there would be formed in the memory
using these ever-changing combinations of astral images some kind
of alchemy of the imagination, a philosopher's stone in the
psyche through which every possible arrangement and combina-tion of objects in the lower world—plants, animals, stones—
would be perceived and remembered ? And that, in the forming
and reforming of the inventor's images in accordance with the
forming and reforming of the astral images on the central wheel,
the whole history of man would be remembered from above, as it
were, all his discoveries, thoughts, philosophies, productions ?
Such a memory would be the memory of a divine man, of a
Magus with divine powers through his imagination harnessed to
the workings of the cosmic powers. And such an attempt would
rest on the Hermetic assumption that man's mens is divine, related
in its origin to the star-governors of the world, able both to reflect
and to control the universe.
Magic assumes laws and forces running through the universe
which the operator can use, once he knows the way to capture
them. As I have emphasised in my other book, the Renaissance
conception of an animistic universe, operated by magic, prepared
the way for the conception of a mechanical universe, operated by
mathematics.69 In this sense, Bruno's vision of an animistic
universe of innumerable worlds through which run the same
magico-mechanical laws, is a prefiguration, in magical terms, of the
seventeenth-century vision. But Bruno's main interest was not in
the outer world but in the inner world. And in his memory systems
we see the effort to operate the magico-mechanical laws, not
externally, but within, by reproducing in the psyche the magical
mechanisms. The translation of this magical conception into
mathematical terms has only been achieved in our own day.

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

Bruno's assumption that the astral forces which govern the outer
world also operate within, and can be reproduced or captured there
to operate a magical-mechanical memory seems to bring one
curiously close to the mind machine which is able to do so much
of the work of the human brain by mechanical means.
Nevertheless, the approach from a mind machine angle does not
really begin to explain Bruno's effort. From the Hermetic universe
in which he lived the divine had not been banished. The astral
forces were instruments of the divine; beyond the operative stars
there were yet higher divine forms. And the highest form was, for
Bruno, the One, the divine unity. The memory system aims at
unification on the star level as a preparation for reaching the
higher Unity. For Bruno, magic was not an end in itself but a
means of reaching the One behind appearances.
This side of Bruno is not absent from Shadows. On the contrary,
the book starts on this level, and readers beginning at the beginning
with the 'thirty intentions of the shadows' and the 'thirty concepts
of ideas', and who either do not reach or entirely fail to recognise
the magical memory system based on thirty to which these
preliminary thirties are the introduction, have been able to accept
the book as some kind of Neoplatonic mysticism. My view, on the
contrary, is that it is only after wrestling with the memory system
that one should approach the preliminary mystical and philo-sophical thirties. I cannot pretend that I fully understand these,
but at least one begins to perceive something of their drift.
The first of the 'thirty intentions of the shadows' begins with
'the one God' and with quotation from the Canticle, 'I sat down
under the shadow of him whom I desired.'70 One must sit under
the shadow of the good and the true. To feel towards this through
the interior senses, through the images in the human mind, is to
sit under the shadow. There follow 'intentions' on light and dark-ness, and on the shadows which, descending from the supersubstantial unity proceed into an infinite multitude; they descend
from the supersubstantial to its vestiges, images, and simulachra.71 Lower things are connected with higher and higher with
lower; to the lyre of the universal Apollo there is a continual rising

and falling through the chain of the elements.72 If the ancients
knew a way by which memory, from the multitude of memorised
species might reach unity, they did not teach it73 (but Giordano
Bruno will teach this). All is in all in nature. So in the intellect
all is in all. And memory can memorise all from all.74 The chaos
of Anaxagoras is variety without order; we must put order into
variety. By making the connections of the higher with the lower
you have one beautiful animal, the world.75 The concord between
higher and lower things is the golden chain from earth to heaven;
as descent can be made from heaven to earth, so ascent may be
made through this order from earth to heaven.76 These connections
are an aid to memory as is shown in the following poem where
Aries acts on Taurus, Taurus on Gemini, Gemini on Cancer, and
so on.77 (There follows a poem on the signs of the zodiac.) Later
'intentions' are about some kind of mystical or magical optics, and
on the sun and the shadows which it casts.
The 'thirty concepts of ideas' are equally gnomic in character.
(Some of them have already been quoted.) The first intellect is the
light of Amphitrite. This is diffused through all; it is the fountain of
unity in which the innumerable is made one.78 The forms of
deformed animals are beautiful in heaven; non-luminous metals
shine in their planets; neither man, nor animals, nor metals are
here as they are there. Illuminating, vivifying, uniting, conforming
yourself to the superior agents you will advance in the conception
and retention of the species.79 The light contains the first life,
intelligence, unity, all species, perfect truths, numbers, grades of
things. Thus what in nature is different, contrary diverse, is there
the same, congruent, One. Try therefore with all your might to
identify, co-ordinate, and unite the received species. Do not dis-turb your mind nor confuse your memory.80 Of all the forms of the
world, the pre-eminent are the celestial forms.81 Through them
you will arrive from the confused plurality of things at the unity.
Parts of the body are better understood together than when taken
separately. Thus when the parts of the universal species are not
considered separately but in relation to their underlying order,
what is there that we may not memorise, understand, and do?82 One

is the splendour of beauty in all. One is the brightness emitted
from the multitude of species.83 The formation of things in the
lower world is inferior to true form, a degradation and vestige of it.
Ascend, then, to where the species are pure, and formed with true
form.84 Everything that is, after the One, is necessarily multiplex
and numerous. Thus on the lowest grade of the scale of nature is
infinite number, on the highest is infinite unity.85 As the ideas are
the principal forms of things, according to which all is formed, so
we should form in us the shadows of ideas. We form them in us, as
in the revolution of wheels.86
I have strung together in the two preceding paragraphs quota-tions from the 'thirty intentions of the shadows' and the 'thirty
concepts of ideas'. These two sets of thirty statements are headed
by thirty letters, which are the same as the letters of the wheel, and
they are illustrated in the text with wheels marked with the thirty
letters. This proves, I think, that the two groups of thirty mys-terious sayings are really about the memory system with its wheels
based on thirty, about a way of grouping, co-ordinating, unifying,
the multiplicity of phenomena in memory, by basing memory on
the higher forms of things, on the star images which are the
'shadows of ideas'.
The thirty 'intentions' contain within them, I think, the element
of voluntas of the direction of the will in love towards truth which
was one aspect of Lullian artificial memory. Hence they can begin
with love poetry from the Canticle. And it is significant that the
wheel which is said to be the 'type of the ideal intentions' has a sun
at the centre of it, emblem of Bruno's inner strivings to arrive at
the One Light which is to appear in memory when all the multipli-city of appearances have been co-ordinated in memory through the
complex techniques of the magic memory system.
This extraordinary work, which was Bruno's first work, is, I
believe, a Great Key to his whole philosophy and outlook, as he
was soon to express it in the Italian dialogues which he published
in England. I have elsewhere pointed out87 that the dialogue with
which Shadows opens in which Hermes presents the book on
memory is couched in terms of a rising sun of Egyptian revelation,

opposed by pedants, which is very similar to those used in the
Cena de le ceneri when Bruno is defending Copernican heliocentricity from pedants. The inner Sun reached in Shadows is the inner
expression of what was to be Bruno's 'Copernicanism', his use of
heliocentricity as a kind of portent of the return of 'Egyptian'
vision and of Hermetic religion.
The philosophy of the two groups of thirty sayings in Shadows
is Bruno's philosophy as we find it in the Italian dialogues. In the
De la causa he cries that the unity of the All in the One is
a most solid foundation for the truths and secrets of nature. For you
must know that it is by one and the same ladder that nature
descends to the production of things and the intellect ascends to
the knowledge of them; and that the one and the other proceeds
from unity and returns to unity, passing through the multitude of
things in the middle.88
The aim of the memory system is to establish within, in the psyche,
the return of the intellect to unity through the organisation of
significant images.
In the Spaccio, he says of the magical religion of the pseudoEgyptians of the Asclepius, which was his own religion, that
with magic and divine rites (they)... ascended to the height of the
divinity by that same scale of nature by which the divinity descends
to the smallest things by the communication of itself.89
The aim of the memory system is to establish this magical ascent
within, through the memory based on the magical star-images.
And in the Eroici furori the enthusiast hunting after the vestiges
of the divine obtains the power of contemplating the beautiful
disposition of the body of nature. He sees Amphitrite, who is the
source of all numbers, the monad, and if he does not see it in its
essence, the absolute light, he sees it in its image, for from the
monad which is the divinity proceeds this monad which is the
world.90 The aim of the memory system is to achieve this unifying
vision within where alone it can be done, for the inner images of
things are nearer to reality, less opaque to the light, than are the
things themselves in the outer world.

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

Thus the classical art of memory, in the truly extraordinary
Renaissance and Hermetic transformation of it which we see in the
memory system of Shadows has become the vehicle for the forma-tion of the psyche of a Hermetic mystic and Magus. The Hermetic
principle of reflection of the universe in the mind as a religious
experience is organised through the art of memory into a magicoreligious technique for grasping and unifying the world of ap-pearances through arrangements of significant images. We saw
this Hermetic transformation of the art of memory taking place
in a much simpler way in Camillo's Theatre. In Bruno, the trans-formation is both infinitely more complex and also very much
more intense, both more extremely magical and also more
extremely religious. The amiable Camillo with his magical
memory and his magical Ciceronian oratory is a very different
figure from the passionate ex-Dominican with his 'Egyptian'
religious message.
Nevertheless, comparison of Bruno's system with Camillo's
is helpful for the understanding of both.
If we think of the seven-fold planetary foundation of Camillo's
Theatre, and of the different grades of being represented on the
upper grades until on the top or 'Prometheus' grade all arts and
sciences were remembered, it is clear that a similar process is going
on in Bruno's system, based on the stars, including animal,
vegetable and mineral worlds on the next wheel and comprising,
with the inventors' wheel, all arts and sciences.
In Camillo's seven-fold system, the seven planetary images,
through which he unifies on the celestial level, connect with and
pass on into a supercelestial world of angelic and Sephirothic
principles. Bruno uses his peculiar transformation of Lullism as
the substitute for Cabalism. His 'Thirty', like Dignities of a
Lullian Art, pass up and down through the lower world, the
celestial world, the divine world, strengthening the ladder between
all levels.
Camillo is much nearer to Pico's original Christian synthesis of
the occult tradition than Bruno. He is able to think of himself as a
Christian Magus in contact with angelic and divine powers which
can ultimately be interpreted as representing the Trinity. Bruno
by his abandonment of the Christian and Trinitarian interpreta-tion of the Hermetica and by his fervent acceptance of the
magical pseudo-Egyptian religion of the Asclepius as better than
229

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF

SHADOWS

91

Christianity, moves back towards a darker magic a more purely
pagan theurgy. He seeks to reach, not a Trinity, but a One. And
this One he thinks of as, not above, but within the world. But his
method of reaching it by first unifying memory on the star level
as the preliminary to arriving at the vision within of the One
light diffused through all, is similar to Camillo's aim, who plans
memory like the ascent of a mountain from the summit of which
all below is unified. In a similar way, Bruno adapts the methods
of the fervently Christian and Trinitarian Lull to his aim of
reaching the One through the All.
These most singular phenomena, the memory systems of
Camillo and of Bruno—both of which were 'secrets' brought to
Kings of France—belong into the Renaissance. No student of the
Renaissance can ignore the glimpses into the Renaissance mind
which they reveal. They belong into that particular strand of the
Renaissance which is the occult tradition. They exhibit a profound
conviction that man, the image of the greater world, can grasp,
hold, and understand the greater world through the power of his
imagination. We come back here to that basic difference between
Middle Ages and Renaissance, the change in the attitude to the
imagination. From a lower power which may be used in memory as
a concession to weak man who may use corporeal similitudes
because only so he can retain his spiritual intentions towards the
intelligible world, it has become man's highest power, by means of
which he can grasp the intelligible world beyond appearances
through laying hold of significant images. The difference is pro-found, and, one would have thought, presents an insuperable
obstacle to any sort of continuity between the art of memory as
understood in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance transformation
of the art. Yet Camillo includes remembering Heaven and Hell in
his Theatre. Bruno in the opening dialogue of Shadows defends the
art of Tullius, Thomas, and Albertus from the attacks of modern
'pedants'. The Middle Ages had transformed the classical art into
a solemn and religious art; and Renaissance occult memory artists
like Camillo and Bruno see themselves as in continuity with the
mediaeval past.

RAMISM AS AN ART OF
MEMORY

URING the period in which occult memory was thus
gathering momentum and becoming increasingly daring
movement against the artificial memory—and I speak of it now as the rational mnemotechnic as a part of classical rhetoric—had also been growing much
stronger. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, the influence of
Quintilian on the humanists was not favourable to the art, and
we have heard Erasmus echoing Quintilian's lukewarm attitude
to places and images and his emphasis on order in memory.
As the sixteenth century advanced, much thought was given by
humanist educators to rhetoric and its parts. For the traditional
five parts as defined by Cicero different arrangements were sugges-ted in which memory dropped out.1 In these trends the influence
of Quintilian was again important, for Quintilian mentions that
some rhetoricians of his time were not including memory as a part
of rhetoric. Amongst the new style sixteenth-century educators
who were omitting memory from the parts of rhetoric was Melanchthon. Naturally, the omission of memory from rhetoric means that
the artificial memory is discarded, and repetition or learning by
heart becomes the only art of memory advised.
Of all the reformers of educational methods in the sixteenth
century the most prominent, or the most self-advertised, was
Pierre de la Ramee, more generally known as Peter Ramus. Ramus

and Ramism have been extensively studied in recent years.2 In
what follows I shall abbreviate as much as possible the complexi-ties of Ramism, referring the reader for further information to the
works of others, my aim being solely to place Ramism within the
context of the argument of this book, where it may come out in a
somewhat new light.
The French dialectician whose simplification of teaching
methods made such a stir was born in 1515 and died in 1572, mas-sacred as a Huguenot in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. This
end recommended him to Protestants, to whom his pedagogical
reforms were also welcome as a means of sweeping out the com-plexities of scholasticism. Amongst the complexities of which
Ramus made a clean sweep were those of the old art of memory.
Ramus abolished memory as a part of rhetoric, and with it he
abolished the artificial memory. This was not because Ramus was
not interested in memorising. On the contrary, one of the chief
aims of the Ramist movement for the reform and simplification of
education was to provide a new and better way of memorising all
subjects. This was to be done by a new method whereby every
subject was to be arranged in 'dialectical order'. This order was set
out in schematic form in which the 'general' or inclusive aspects of
the subject came first, descending thence through a series of
dichotomised classifications to the 'specials' or individual aspects.
Once a subject was set out in its dialectical order it was memorised
in this order from the schematic presentation—the famous
Ramist epitome.
As Ong has said, the real reason why Ramus could dispense with
memory as a part of rhetoric 'is that his whole scheme of the arts
based on a topically conceived logic, is a system of local memory'.3
And Paolo Rossi has seen that by absorbing memory into logic,
Ramus identified the problem of method with that of memory.4
Ramus knew very well the precepts of the old artificial memory

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

which he was consciously supplanting, and he had been influenced
by Quintilian's criticism of it. In an important and, I believe,
unnoticed passage in the Scholae in liberates artes, Ramus quotes
Quintilian's remarks on the ineptitude of places and images for
confirming memory, his rejection of the methods of Carneades,
Metrodorus, and Simonides, and his recommendation of a simpler
way of memorising through dividing and composing the material.
He approves and praises Quintilian for these views and asks
where can such an art of memory be found which will teach to
memorise, not with places and images, but through 'dividing
and composing' as Quintilian advises.
The art of memory (says Quintilian) consists entirely in division
and composition. If we seek then an art which will divide and
compose things, we shall find the art of memory. Such a doctrine is
expounded in our dialectical precepts . . . and method . . . For the
true art of memory is one and the same as dialectics.5
Thus Ramus thinks of his dialectical method for memorising as the
true classical art of memory, the way which Quintilian preferred
to the places and images of Cicero and of the author of Ad Herennium.
Though Ramus rejects the loci and imagines his method yet
includes some of the old precepts. Arrangement in order had been
one of these, strongly insisted on by Aristotle and by Thomas
Aquinas. In the memory text-books of Romberch and Rossellius a
way is taught of arranging material in inclusive 'common places'
within which are individual places; this has something in common
with Ramus's insistence on descending from 'generals' to 'specials'.
Ramus classifies memory into 'natural' and 'prudential'; in the
latter term he may be influenced by the old insistence on memory
as a part of Prudence. And, as Ong has pointed out,6 the memorising
from the epitomes set out in order on the printed page has in it an
element of spatial visualisation. It should be added that here again
the influence of Quintilian is to be perceived, who advised memo-rising from visualisation of the actual page or tablet on which the
speech was written. Where I would differ from Ong is in his

233

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

insistence that this spatial visualisation for memorisation was a new
development introduced by the printed book.7 Rather, it would
seem to me, the printed Ramist epitomes are a transfer to the
printed book of the visually ordered and schematised lay-outs of
manuscripts. The late F. Saxl made a study of the transition of
manuscript illustrations to early printed books;8 the transition of
schematic lay-outs of material from manuscripts to the printed
Ramist epitomes would be a parallel phenomenon.
Though many surviving influences of the old art of memory may
be detected in the Ramist 'method' of memorising through
dialectical order, yet he deliberately gets rid of its most charac-teristic feature, the use of the imagination. No more will places in
churches or other buildings be vividly impressed on the imagina-tion. And, above all, gone in the Ramist system are the images, the
emotionally striking and stimulating images the use of which had
come down through the centuries from the art of the classical
rhetor. The 'natural' stimulus for memory is now not the emotion-ally exciting memory image; it is the abstract order of dialectical
analysis which is yet, for Ramus, 'natural', since dialectical order
is natural to the mind.
An example may bring out the abandonment of a most ancient
mental habit brought about by the Ramist reform. We want to
remember, or to teach to the young, the liberal art of Grammar and
its parts. Romberch gives in a column on his printed page the
parts of Grammar set out in order—an arrangement analogous to
the Ramist epitome. But Romberch teaches that we are to remem-ber Grammar with an image—the ugly old woman Grammatica—
and on her stimulating-to-memory form we visualise the argu-ments about her parts through subsidiary images, inscriptions and
the like.9 Under Ramism, we smash the inner image of old Gram-matica, and teach little boys to do so, substituting for her the
imageless Ramist epitome of Grammar memorised from the
printed page.
The extraordinary success of Ramism, in itself rather a super-ficial pedagogic method, in Protestant countries like England may
perhaps be partly accounted for by the fact that it provided a kind

of inner iconoclasm, corresponding to the outer iconoclasm. Old
Grammatica on the portal of some church sculptured with the
series of the liberal arts would get the same kind of outer treatment
in a rampantly Protestant country as she gets inwardly in Ramism.
She would be smashed. In an earlier chapter10 we suggested that
Romberch's encyclopaedic presentation of theological and philo-sophical sciences and of the liberal arts, to be memorised by
corporeal similitudes of them, accompanied by images of notable
practitioners of each art, was perhaps a distant echo of the memory
of Thomas Aquinas as we see it symbolised in the fourteen simili-tudes of arts and sciences, accompanied by fourteen practitioners
of them, in the fresco of Santa Maria Novella (P1. I). If we were to
imagine something like the figures of that fresco sculptured on
some English cathedral or church, the niches would now be, either
empty of the destroyed images, or such images as remained would
be damaged. So did Ramism inwardly remove the images of the
art of memory.
Ramus envisaged his 'dialectical analysis' method as suitable to
be used for memorising all subjects, and even for memorising
passages of poetry. The first Ramist epitome to appear in print is an
analysis of the dialectical order of the complaint of Penelope in
Ovid.11 As Ong has pointed out, Ramus makes quite clear that the
object of this exercise is to enable a schoolboy to memorise by this
method the twenty-eight lines of Ovid in question.12 To this it may
be added that it is also quite clear that Ramus intends this method
to supplant the classical art. Immediately after the epitomised
'dialectical analysis' of the argument of the lines he speaks of that
art of memory with places and images which is greatly inferior to
his own method, for it uses external signs and images artificially
made up, whereas he follows the parts of the composition in a
natural way. Hence the dialectical doctrine replaces all other
doctrines ad memoriam confirmandam.13 Though one would hesitate
to advise schoolboys to construct images of Domitius being beaten
up by the Rex family, or of Aesop and Cimber being made up for
their parts as memory-for-words cues for their recitation, yet one

also wonders what became in the Ramist method of the musical
rhythm of the poem and of its imagery.
Ramus is so constantly aware of the old artificial memory as he
replaces it by his 'natural' art that one may almost think of the
Ramist method as yet another transformation of the classical art
—a transformation which keeps and intensifies the principle of
order but does away with the 'artificial' side, the side which
cultivated the imagination as the chief instrument of memory.
In considering the reactions of sixteenth-century moderns, like
Erasmus, Melanchthon, and Ramus to the art of memory we must
constantly bear in mind that the art had reached their times pro-foundly coloured by the mediaeval transformation through which
it had passed. It appeared to them as a mediaeval art, an art
belonging to the times of the old architecture and imagery, an art
which had been adopted and recommended by the scholastics, an
art particularly associated with the friars and their sermons. To the
humanist scholar, moreover, it was an art which in the old ignorant
times had been wrongly bound up with 'Tullius' as the author of
Ad Herennium. The humanist educator, enraptured by the elegance
of Quintilian, would be inclined to take his attitude to the art as the
more purely classical attitude of informed criticism. Erasmus was a
humanist in reaction from the 'barbarism' of the Middle Ages.
Melanchthon and Ramus were protestants in reaction from scho-lasticism with which the old art of memory had been associated.
Ramus, with his insistence on logical order in memory, is adopting
a side of the 'Aristotelianised' scholastic art of memory whilst
rejecting its corporeal similitudes, so closely linked with the old
didactic method of presenting moral and religious truths through
images.
Ramus never obtrudes his religious views in his pedagogical
works but he wrote one theological work 'On the Christian
Religion' in which he makes very plain what was his attitude to
images from the religious point of view.14 He quotes Old Testa-ment prohibition of images, particularly from the fourth chapter of
Deuteronomy:—'Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for
ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spoke unto
you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: Lest ye corrupt your14

236

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

selves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure
the likeness of male or female . . . And lest thou lift up thine eyes,
unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the
stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship
them . . .' With the old Testament prohibition of graven images,
Ramus contrasts Greek idolatrous worship and then goes on to
speak of the images in Catholic churches to which the people bow
and burn incense before them. It is unnecessary to quote the pas-sage in full for it conforms to the normal type of Protestant
propaganda against Catholic images. It places Ramus as sympa-thetic to the iconoclastic movements which raged during his
lifetime in France, England, and the Low Countries; and I would
suggest that it is relevant to his attitude to images in the art of
memory.
Ramism cannot be entirely identified with Protestantism for it
seems to have been popular with some French Catholics, particu-larly with the Guise family, and was taught to their relative, Mary,
Queen of Scots.15 Nevertheless, Ramus became a Protestant
martyr after his death in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, a fact
which certainly had much to do with the popularity of Ramism in
England. And there can be no doubt that an art of memory based
on imageless dialectical order as the true natural order of the mind
goes well with Calvinist theology.
If Ramus and the Ramists were opposed to the images of the old
art of memory, what would be their attitude to the art in its occult,
Renaissance transformation, with its use of magic, 'graven images'
of the stars as memory images ? Their disapproval of the art in this
form would surely be even more profound.
Though Ramism is aware of the old art of memory and retains
some of its order, whilst discarding places and images, it is in
many respects closer to the other type of 'artificial memory' which
was not in descent from the rhetoric tradition and which also made
no use (in its genuine form) of images. I am speaking, of course, of
Lullism. Lullism, like Ramism, included logic in memory for the
Lullian Art, as memory, memorised the logical processes of intel-lect. And another characteristic feature of Ramism, its arrangement
or classification of matter in an order descending from 'generals'
to 'specials' is a notion implicit in Lullism as it ascends and des-cends on the ladder of being from specials to generals and from
15

Howell, Logic and Rhetoric, pp. 166 ff.

237

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

generals to specials. This terminology is specifically used of
memory in Lull's Liber ad memoriam confirmandam in which it is
stated that memory is to be divided into specials and generals, the
specials descending from the generals.16 In Lullism, the 'generals'
are, of course, the principles of the Art, founded on Divine
Dignities. The arbitrary manner in which Ramism imposes its
'dialectical order' on every branch of knowledge is strongly
reminiscent of Lullism which claims to unify and simplify the
whole encyclopaedia by imposing B to K and the procedures of the
Art on every subject. Ramism as memory, memorising every sub-ject by the dialectical order of its epitome,17 is a process akin to
Lullism as memory, memorising every subject by memorising the
procedures of the Art as done on that subject.
There can be little doubt that the genesis of Ramism owes some-thing to the Renaissance revival of Lullism. Nevertheless there are
most profound differences between Ramism and Lullism. Ramism
is superficial to child's play compared to the subtleties of Lullism
with its attempt to base logic and memory on the structure of the
universe.
Ramism as a memory method is clearly moving in an exactly
opposite direction from Renaissance occult memory, which seeks
to intensify the use of images and of the imagination, seeks even
to introduce images into the imageless Lullism. And yet there is a
problem here which I can only suggest without attempting to
solve it.
It is possible that Giulio Camillo with his occult rhetoric,
involving some new and mysterious kind of conflation of logical
topics with memory places, involving also an interest in the rhe-toric of Hermogenes,18 was the real initiator of some of the new
16

Lull, Liber ad memoriam confirmandam, ed. Rossi in Clavis universalis,
p. 262.
17
The genesis of the Ramist epitome should probably be sought in
Lullian manuscripts with their heavily bracketed schemata. Examples of
such lay-outs can be seen in Thomas Le Myesier's compendum of
Lullism (Paris, Bibl. Nat., Lat. 15450, on which see my article 'The Art
of R.L.', p. 172). Such Lullist lay-outs, with their series of brackets (for
example the one in Paris, Lat., 15450, f. 99 verso) make a very similar
impression to the bracketed Ramist epitome, for example the epitome of
logic, reproduced in Ong, Ramus, p. 202.
18

238

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

rhetorical and methodological movements of the sixteenth cen-tury? Johannes Sturm, so important in the new movements,
carried on the revival of Hermogenes.19 And Sturm certainly knew
of Giulio Camillo and his Memory Theatre.20 Sturm was the
patron of Alessandro Citolini whose Tipocosmia was said to have
been 'stolen' from the papers of Camillo's Theatre.21 If this is true
Citolini 'stole' only an encyclopaedic setting out in order of
subjects and themes—for that is what the Tipocosmia is—but
without the images. For there are no images or descriptions of
images in the Tipocosmia. What I am getting at—in the form of
questions or hints for future investigators—is that Camillo might
have started on his transcendental or occult level a rhetoricalmethodological-memory movement which people like Sturm and
Ramus continued, but rationalised by omitting the images.
Leaving aside the undigested and controversial hints in the
preceding paragraph, it seems to me certain that Ramus, the
Frenchman, would have known of Camillo's Theatre, so famous in
France. Since he would certainly have known of it, it may be
raised as a possibility that the Ramist dialectical order for memory,
descending from 'generals' to 'specials' might have had in it some-thing of a conscious reaction from the occult method of the
Theatre, which arranges knowledge under the 'generals' of the
planets, from which all the multitude of 'special' things in the
world descend.
When we take a look into Ramus's philosophical attitudes, the
curious fact emerges that there is a good deal of mysticism behind
the apparently intense rationalism of his 'dialectical order'.

Betussi (Raverta, ed. Zonta, p. 57) associates Citolini's Tipocosmia
with Camillo's Theatre. Others make the blunt accusation that Citolini
stole from Camillo; for references about this see Liruti, I I I , pp. 130,133,
137 ff. The Tipocosmia was published at Venice in 1561. Citolini came to
England as a Protestant exile with letters of recommendation from
Sturm (see L. Fessia, A. Citolini, esule italiano in Inghilterra, Milan,
1939–40). The 'poor Italian gentleman' mentioned by Bruno as having
had his leg broken by the roughness of the London crowds was Citolini
(see G. Bruno, La Cena de le ceneri, ed. G. Aquilecchia, Turin, 1955,
p. 138).
239

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

Ramus's philosophical views can be culled from the first two works
in which he enunciated his dialectical method—the Aristotelicae
animadversiones and the Dialecticae institutiones. He seems to
envisage the true dialectical principles as deriving from a kind of
prisca theologia. Prometheus, he says, was the first to open the
fountains of dialectical wisdom whose pristine waters eventually
reached Socrates. (Compare this with Ficino's prtsca theologia
sequence in which ancient wisdom through a line of successors
eventually reaches Plato.22) The ancient, true, and natural
dialectic was, however, says Ramus depraved and spoiled by
Aristotle who introduced artificiality and falsehood into dialectic.
Ramus conceives it as his mission to restore the dialectical art to its
'natural' form, its pre-Aristotelian, Socratic and pristine nature.
This natural dialectic is the image in the mens of the eternal divine
light. The return to dialectic is a return to light from shadows. It is
a way of ascent and descent from specials to generals, from generals
to specials, which is like Homer's golden chain from earth to
heaven, from heaven to earth.23 Ramus repeatedly uses the 'golden
chain' image of his system, and in a long passage in the Dialecticae
institutiones he uses most of the major themes of Renaissance
Neoplatonism, including the inevitable quotation of the Virgilian
'Spiritus intus alit', and extols his true natural dialectic as a kind of
Neoplatonic mystery, a way of return to the light of the divine
mens from the shadows.24
Viewed from this background of Ramus's thought, the dialectical
method begins to lose some of its apparent rationality. It is an
'ancient wisdom' which Ramus is reviving. It is an insight into the
nature of reality through which he can unify the multiplicity of
appearances. By imposing the dialectical order on every subject the
mind can make the ascent and descent from specials to generals
22

'Prisca theologia' was the term used by Ficino for the wisdom of
ancient sages, such as Hermes Trismegistus. He regarded such 'pristine
theology' as a current of wisdom descending from Hermes and others
until it eventually reached Plato; see D . P. Walker, 'The Prtsca Theologia
in France'. fournal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XVII (1954),
pp. 204 ff.; Yates, G.B. and H.T., pp. 14 ff. Ramus's mind is working on
similar lines, though with Prometheus as a pristine dialectician whose
wisdom descended to Socrates.

240

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

and vice versa. The Ramist method begins to appear almost as
mystical a conception as the Art of Ramon Lull, which imposes
the abstractions of the Divine Dignities on every subject and there-by makes the ascent and descent. And it begins to appear not dis-similar in aim from Camillo's Theatre which provides the unifying
ascent and descent through arrangements of images, or from
Bruno's method in Shadows of seeking the unifying system by
which the mind may return to the light from the shadows.
And, in fact, many were to labour at finding points of contact and
amalgamation between all such methods or systems. As we have
seen, Lullism was amalgamated with the art of memory; attempts
were also made to amalgamate it with Ramism. The search for
method by ways infinitely complex and intricate, occult or rational,
Lullist, Ramist, and so on, is a major characteristic of the period.
And the instigator, the originator, the common root of all this
effort after method, so fraught with consequences for the future, is
memory. Whoever wishes to probe the origins and growth of
methodological thinking should study the history of the art of
memory, in its mediaeval transformation, in its occult transforma-tion, memory as Lullism, memory as Ramism. And it may appear
when this history is fully written, that the occult transformation of
memory was an important stage in the whole process of the search
for method.
Whilst, when viewed from a historical distance, all the memory
methods are seen to have certain common denominators, when seen
at close quarters, or from the point of view of contemporaries, a
great gulf separates Peter Ramus from Giordano Bruno. The super-ficial resemblances are that both claim descent from ancient
wisdoms—Ramus from a Socratic pre-Aristotelian wisdom, Bruno
from a pre-Greek Egyptian and Hermetic wisdom. Both are
violently anti-Aristotelian, though for different reasons. Both make
an art of memory the instrument of a reform. Ramus reforms
teaching methods by his memory method based on dialectical order.
Bruno teaches an occult art of memory as an instrument of a Her-metic religious reform. Ramus discards imagery and the imagination,
and drills memory with abstract order. Bruno makes imagery and
the imagination the whole key to a significant organisation of
memory. Ramus breaks the continuity with the old classical art in its
mediaeval transformation. Bruno claims that his occult system is
241

RAMISM AS AN ART OF MEMORY

still the art of Tullius, Thomas, and Albertus. The one is a
Calvinist pedagogue providing a simplified teaching method; the
other a passionate ex-friar using occult memory as a magicoreligious technique. Ramus and Bruno stand at opposite poles;
they represent totally contrary tendencies of the late Renaissance.
Amongst the 'pedants' whom Bruno attacks at the beginning of
Shadows for their contempt of the art of memory, we must range,
not only the humanist critics, but the Ramists, with their campaign
forcibly directed against images in memory. If Erasmus did not
think much of Camillo's Theatre, what would Ramus have
thought, had he been alive, of Bruno's Shadows ? The 'arch pedant
of France', as Bruno calls Ramus, would certainly have been
horrified at Bruno's way of ascent and descent, of reaching the
light from the shadows.

T must have been soon after his arrival in England, early in
1583, that Bruno published the massive volume on memory
which I refer to as Seals,1 though it really consists of four
items, as follows:
Ars reminiscendi
Triginta sigilli
Explanatio triginta sigillorum
Sigillus sigillorum

The title-page gives no place or date of publication but the book
almost certainly appeared early in 1583 and was quite certainly
printed by John Charlewood, a London printer.2 The Ars reminis-cendi was not a new work but a reprint of the art of memory in
Circe,3 published in the preceding year in Paris, where it had
followed the terrific incantations of Circe to the seven planets.4
These incantations, which made the magical character of the follow-ing art of memory obvious to Parisian readers (who could also have
read the occult Shadows) are not included in the reprint published

in England. The English reprint of the ArS reminiscendi is however
followed by new material, namely the 'Thirty Seals', the 'Explana-tion of the Thirty Seals', and the 'Seal of Seals'.
If all readers of Bruno's Shadows have missed the magical
memory system, readers of Seals have made even less headway
with that work. What are these 'Seals'? As a preliminary to
attempting to answer that question I invite the reader to come with
me for a page or two to Florence where we will practise the art of
memory together.
Agostino del Riccio was a Dominican friar of the convent of
Santa Maria Novella in Florence who wrote in 1595 an Arte delle
memoria locale for the use of'studious young gentlemen'. This little
treatise was never published but the manuscript of it exists in the
Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence.5 It is illustrated by seven draw-ings which are intended to make clear to the young gentlemen of
Florence the principles of the art of memory.
'The King' (P1. 13a) shows a king who is striking his brow; he
represents 'local memory', calling up by this gesture the local
memory which is so useful to preachers, orators, students, and all
classes of people.6
'The First Counsellor' (P1. 13b) shows a man touching a globe on
which are all places—cities, castles, shops, churches, palaces. He
represents the first precept of the art, and the friar gives here the
usual place rules. He also gives an example of making memory
places in the church of Santa Maria Novella in which, beginning
from the high altar, you may place there Charity; then continuing
round the church you will perhaps place on the altar of the Ciodi,
Hope; on the altar of the Gaddi, Faith, then continue to place on
all the other chapel altars, on the holy water stoup, on the tombs,
and so on, until you come round to the point at which you started.7
The friar is teaching us the good old fashioned way of using the
art, to remember virtues.

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

'The Second Counsellor' (P1. 13c) shows a man surrounded by
various objects, including a statue, or rather a bust on a pillar. He
represents the precept 'use images'. These can be images of real
objects, or imaginary, or we may usefiguresmade by sculptors and
artists. Signor Niccolo Gaddi has some fine statues in his gallery
which are useful for memory images.8 After this glimpse of an
artistically furnished memory, we are presented with those
alphabetical lists which are such a trying feature of the memory
treatises. Riccio's lists include mechanical arts, saints, and
Florentine families.
'The First Captain or the Straight Line' shows a man with a
vertical line passing down his body. On him are to be placed the
twelve signs of the zodiac, in accordance with the parts of the body
over which they rule, and they are to be remembered on these
places as a memory system.9
'The Second Captain or the Circular Line' (P1. 13d) is a man in a
circle with legs and arms extended. On the places of this man's
body we are to remember the four elements and the eleven
heavens: earth, feet; water, knee; air, flank; fire, arm; Luna, right
hand; Mercury, fore-arm; Venus, shoulder; Sol, head; Mars, left
shoulder; Jupiter, left fore-arm; Saturn, left hand; sphere of fixed
stars, left shoulder; christalline sphere, waist; primum mobile,
knees; Paradise, under left foot.10
In 'The Third Captain or the Transverse Line' (P1. 13c) twelve
small objects are seen, placed on a circle. The friar explains that he
memorises these objects on places in the Via della Scala.11 Those
who know Florence will remember that this street still runs into the
Piazza Santa Maria Novella. On the Tabernacle in this street he
memorises a religious with his cross (see the cross at the top of the
circle); on the door of the first house of the row of old houses, he
remembers a star; on the door of Jacopo di Borgho's house, a sun;
and so on. He also uses the method in a cell of the Dominican
fathers, divided into memory places, memorising thereby, for
example, that fine conceit of Job on the seven miseries of man.12
'The Meal and the Servant' (P1. 13f) presents a man holding food
and drink. Local memory is like eating and drinking. If we ate all
our food at once we should have indigestion, so we divide it into
separate meals. So we should do with local memory; 'two hundred

notions a day, or two hundred articles of St. Thomas, if we try to
memorise them immediately on rising from bed, we shall strain
the memory too much.'13 Therefore take local memory in small
doses. Maybe in time we may rise to the heights reached by the
famous preacher, Francesco Panigarola, who is said to have used a
hundred thousand places.14
This friar has not heard of exciting Renaissance transformations
of the art of memory. He belongs to the old order of things. Placing
his images of virtues on memory places in the church of Santa
Maria Novella—once a centre whence the Dominican movement
radiated in such force—he is using the technique in the devotional
way which, when at the height of its intensity, stimulated the
proliferation of virtue and vice imagery. No suspicion need be
attached to his use of the zodiac, which is automatically mentioned
in memory treatises as a possible system; there is no reason at all
why the order of the signs should not be used in a rational way as a
memory order. He aims at memorising the order of the spheres, but
in a way which, though puerile, is not magical. He is using the
traditional Dominican art, memorising by the method pious
material, including the Summa of Thomas Aquinas. He is an
example of the enfeeblement of the art since its great era in the
Middle Ages, exhibiting the kind of mentality which is to be found
in the late memory treatises.
Why then, do I introduce Fra Agostino del Riccio here ? Because
his idea of presenting the principles and various techniques of the
art through little symbolic pictures, with titles, exactly corresponds
to what Bruno does in Seals, where, for example, the principle of
association is presented as 'The Joiner', or the use of images as
'Zeuxis the Painter'. This is what the Seals are, statements of the
principles and techniques of the art—but magicised, complicated
with Lullism and Cabbalism, blown up into inscrutable mysteries.
Bruno was adapting to his own strange purposes a mode of present-ing the art which he had learned in his Dominican convent.
The Elizabethan reader who attempted to tackle the curious
work which had been published, rather clandestinely (no place or
date of publication given) in his country, would presumably begin
13
14

246

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

at the beginning with the Ars reminiscendi.15 Continuing to use his
terminology of 'subjects' for memory places and 'adjects' for
memory images, Bruno gives in this art the classical rules, expand-ing them very much after the manner of a normal memory
treatise.16 Bruno seems to aim at making a very large number of
places. Nothing prevents you when you have been through your
house in one part of the city from using (for making memory
places in) another house in another part of the city. When you have
finished the last of the Roman places, you can connect it with the
first of the Parisian places.17 (One is reminded of Peter of Raven-na's custom of collecting memory places on his travels.18) Bruno
insists that the images must be striking, and associated with one
another. He gives a list of thirty ways of forming images to remind
of notions through association19 (such lists are also given in the
normal treatises). He believes that he has a better system for
memory for words than Tullius thought of, quoting here from Ad
Herennium as by Tullius, and thus keeping up the old wrong
mediaeval attribution.20 He recommends as place systems what
he calls 'semi-mathematical' subjects,21 that is diagrammatical
figures which are not mathematical in the normal way, but in
some other way.
Anyone who had seen a Romberch or a Rossellius would be able
to recognise this Ars reminiscendi as belonging into a well known
genre, that of the memory treatise. But Bruno claims that, although
he uses all the old ways, he has some new and better way of using
them. This new way is connected with the 'Song of Circe'22
(presumably the incantations to the planets in Circe which are not
included with the Ars reminiscendi in the English publication).
There was therefore some Circaean mystification at the heart of
this memory treatise, but what it was exactly the Elizabethan
reader might well have been somewhat at a loss to understand.
And then he would reach the great barrage of the Thirty Seals,
thirty statements of principles and techniques of magic memory,
followed by thirty more or less inexplicable 'explanations', some

of which are illustrated with more or less insoluble 'semi-mathe-matical' diagrams. One wonders how many readers ever got
through this barrage.
The first seal is 'The Field'.23 This field is the memory, or the
phantasy, the ample folds of which are to be worked upon by the
art of places and images. Brief though obscure summaries of the
rules are given here, with insistence that images must have power
to move through their striking and unusual character. There is
also a reference to 'Solyman the Thalmudist' who had a memory
system in twelve divisions marked with the names of the patriarchs.
The second Seal is T h e Heaven' (P1. 14a).24 So that 'the order
and the series of the images of heaven may be engraved' a sphere
divided in a certain manner will give places and sites. The descrip-tion of this figure is supplemented by a diagram which is based on
the twelve houses of a horoscope. Bruno is using the houses of a
horoscope as memory places, or memory rooms, in which the
'images of heaven' will be engraved.
The Seal of 'The Chain'25 emphasises that memory must pro-ceed from the preceding to what follows as parts of a chain are
involved with the preceding and following links. This sounds like
association of ideas, as in the Aristotelianising of the memory rules.
But in the explanation of this Seal we are told that the chain is
really the zodiac, the signs of which run on, the one into the other,
and he refers to what he has said about this in Shadows, quoting the
same Latin poem on the order of the signs which he had quoted
there.26
It is at this point that we begin to wonder, in a confused way,
whether the Seals, or some of them, are really about the memory
system in Shadows.
The next three Seals are Lullist. The 'Tree' and the 'Wood'27
are connected with Lull's Arbor scientiae, which is mentioned by
name, as a wood all the trees of which, representing all knowledge,
are rooted in basic principles common to all. The 'Ladder'28 gives
what is actually the third figure of Lull's Ars brevis showing

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

combinations of letters combined on the Lullian wheels. Again we
wonder whether these Seals are giving the principle of using Lullian
combinatory systems with the astrologised and magicised classical
art of memory, as in Shadows.
And these wonderings are turned into a certainty in 'Zeuxis the
Painter' (Seal 12) who represents the principle of using images in
the art of memory. Here we are told that 'the images of Teucer the
Babylonian supply me with the indications of three hundred
thousand propositions'.29 And if any more proof is needed of the
connection of Seals with Shadows there is this further remark in
'Zeuxis the Painter':
Now for the improving of natural memory and the teaching of
artificial memory, we know a double picture; the one when we form
from strange descriptions images and notae for retaining in memory
of which I give examples in the art attached to De umbris idearum;
the other by feigning as need requires edifices . . . and images of
sensible things which will remind us of non-sensible things to be
remembered.30
The 'double picture' of the two kinds of memory consists, I
believe, (1) of the memory based on the astral images such as he
gave lists of in Shadows and is discussing in Seals (2) of the normal
classical memory using places in 'edifices'. But in Bruno's systems
the techniques even of normal classical memory are never being
used normally, but are always galvanised into magical activity
through being affiliated to astral systems.
The Seals, though several of them allude to the system in
Shadows, are not confined to any one system. On the contrary
Bruno states that he is trying every possible way; perhaps something
for which he is not looking may emerge out of this, as alchemists
who do not succeed in making gold sometimes hit on other
important discoveries.31 In the later Seals he is trying variations of
astrological arrangements, devices of a Lullist nature (or what he
supposes to be Lullist), infiltrations of Cabalist magic in the unend-ing search for a really operative organisation of the psyche. And
the search always brings in the tricks of the memory trade, the old
techniques of which can be recognised in Seal after Seal, though
now presented as occult mysteries. My attitude towards the reader
of this book has always been the humane one of trying to spare him

the more awful ordeals of memory and I shall therefore not enume-rate the whole Thirty of the Seals but present only a few selections.
Seal 9 'The Table' 32 describes that interesting form of the
'visual alphabet' which consists of remembering letters by images
of people whose names begin with those letters. Peter of Ravenna,
it will be remembered produced the prize example of this method
by making Eusebius and Thomas change places to help him to
remember ET and TE. 33 Bruno mentions Peter of Ravenna with
admiration in this Seal. Seal II, 'The Standard',34 stands for
leading images as standard-bearers for whole groups of things;
thus Plato, Aristotle, Diogenes, a Pyhrronian, an Epicurean, would
serve to indicate not merely those individuals but many notions
having affinity with them. This is the ancient tradition through
which images of notable practitioners of the arts and sciences were
regarded as memory images. Seal 14, 'Daedalus',35 gives a list of
memory objects to be attached to, or placed on, main images to be
used for organising a cluster of meanings around a main image.
Bruno's memory objects belong into the ancient tradition for such
lists. Seal 15, 'The Numerator'36 describes how to form images for
numbers with objects whose shapes resemble the numbers. This
was a notion frequently illustrated in the old memory treatises in
which sets of objects-for-numbers are presented together with the
'visual alphabets', or illustrations of sets of objects resembling
letters. Seal 18, 'The Century'37 arranges groups of a hundred
friends in a hundred places, a valuable example of the classical
precept of making memory images like people we know. Seal 19,
'Squaring the Circle'38 is based on the inevitable horoscope
diagram. Bruno solves this ancient problem by using a 'semimathematical', that is magical figure as a memory place system.
Seal 21, 'The Potter's Wheel' (P1. 14b)39 is again the horoscope
diagram with a bar marked with the initials of the seven planets
revolving within it; this is a very difficult system. Seal 23, 'The
Doctor'40 uses diiferent kinds of shops, butcher, baker, barber,
and so on, as memory places, as in the method illustrated by one of
the cuts (P1. 5a) in Romberch's book. But Bruno's shops are not as

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

straightforward as that. 'The Field and Garden of Circe' (Seal
26)41 is an extremely magical system, evidently only to be achieved
after successful invocation to the seven planets. Here the elemental
compounds—hot-moist, hot-dry, cold-moist, cold-dry—mutate
and move through places in seven houses to form the changing
forms of elemental nature within the psyche. In the 'Peregrinator'
(Seal 25),42 memory images peregrinate through memory rooms,
each image drawing from the material memorised in the rooms
what it needs. In 'The Cabalistic Enclosure' (Seal 28)43 the orders
of society both ecclesiastical and temporal, from Popes to Deacons
and from Kings to Peasants are represented by memory images,
ranged in the order of their rank. This was a well-known memory
order, often mentioned in the memory treatises as an easily memo-rised order of figures. But in Bruno's system, the orders perform
Cabalistic permutations and combinations among themselves.
The last two Seals ('Combiner', 29, and 'Interpreter', 30)44 are
respectively Lullist combinations and Cabalist manipulations of
the Hebrew alphabet.
What is this man trying to do ? He is working with two sets of
ideas, memory and astrology. The memory tradition taught that
everything is better remembered through an image, that these
images should be striking and emotionally powerful, that they
should be linked to one another associatively. Bruno tries to work
memory systems based on these principles by Unking them to the
astrological system, using magically potent images, 'semi-mathe-matical' or magical places, and the associative orders of astrology.
With this he mixes Lullist combinations and Cabalist magic!
The notion of combining memory principles with astral princi-ples is present in Camillo's Theatre. Bruno wants to work this idea
out in much more scientific detail. We saw this effort in action in
the system in Shadows, to which the Seals often allude, but in Seals
Bruno is trying method after method, system after system in
pursuit of his aim. The mind machine analogy again suggests
itself. Bruno believes that if he can make a system which gets inside
the astrological system, which reflects the permutations and com-binations of the changing relations of the planets to the zodiac and
their influences on the horoscopal houses, he will be tapping the
mechanisms of nature herself to organise the psyche. However, as

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

we saw in the last chapter, the view of Bruno's memory systems as
magical ancestors of the mind machine is only partially valuable
and must not be pressed too far. If we drop the word 'magical' and
think of the efforts of an occult memory artist as directed towards
drawing out of the psyche combinations of 'archetypal' images
we come within range of some major trends of modern
psychological thought. However, as with the mind machine analogy,
I would not stress a Jungian analogy which might confuse more
than it illuminates.
I would prefer to keep within the period and try to think of the
period aspects of Bruno's memory attempts. One of these aspects
connects with Bruno's anti-Aristotelian philosophy of nature.
Speaking of the 'standard bearing' images in the memory as related
to the astral groupings of nature, he says:
All things of nature and in nature, like soldiers in an army, follow
leaders assigned to them . . . This Anaxagoras knew very well but
Father Aristotle could not attain to it. . . with his impossible and
fictitious logical segregations of the truth of things.45
This reveals a root of Bruno's anti-Aristotelianism; the astral
groupings in nature contradict Aristotle and a man with an
astrally based memory cannot think on Aristotelian lines in his
natural philosophy. Through the magic of his archetypal memory
images he sees the groupings of nature as bound together with
magical and associative links.
Or if we think of the Renaissance interpretation of the magic of
images we find ourselves within another aspect of Bruno's attitude
to memory. We saw that the magic of magic images could be
interpreted in the Renaissance as an artistic magic; the image be-came endued with aesthetic power through being endowed with
perfect proportions. We would expect to find that in a highly
gifted nature, such as that of Giordano Bruno, the intensive inner
training of the imagination in memory might take notable inner
forms. And in the discussion of 'Zeuxis the Painter' and of
'Phidias the Sculptor' in the Seals bearing those titles, Bruno
reveals himself as a memory artist of the Renaissance.
Zeuxis, the painter, painting the inner images of memory,
introduces a comparison of painting with poetry. To painters and
poets says Bruno, there is distributed an equal power. The painter
45

Ibid., p. 133.
252

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

excels in imaginative power (phantastica virtus); the poet excels in
cogitative power to which he is impelled by an enthusiasm, deriv-ing from a divine afflatus to give expression. Thus the source of the
poet's power is close to that of the painter.
Whence philosophers are in some ways painters and poets; poets
are painters and philosophers; painters are philosophers and poets.
Whence true poets, true painters, and true philosophers seek one
another out and admire one another.46
For there is no philosopher who does not mould and paint;
whence that saying is not to be feared 'to understand is to specu-late with images', and the understanding 'either is the fantasy or
does not exist without it'.
To come upon the equation of poetry with painting in the con-text of the images of the art of memory reminds one, that according
to Plutarch, it was Simonides, the inventor of the art of memory,
who was the first to make this comparison.47 Bruno is however
here recalling the ut pictura poesis, the dictum of Horace on which
the Renaissance based its theories of poetry and painting. To this
he relates the Aristotelian dictum 'to think is to speculate with
images'48 which had been used in the scholastic conflation of
Aristotle with 'Tullius' on the classical memory49 and is often
repeated in the memory treatises. And thus, through Zeuxis the
Painter who is the painter of images in memory, who stands for
the classical rule 'use images', he arrives at the vision of the Poet,
the Painter, and the Philosopher as all fundamentally the same, all
painters of images in the fantasy, like Zeuxis who paints the
memory images, expressed by the one as poetry, by the other as
painting, by the third as thought.
'Phidias the Sculptor' stands for the sculptor of the memory,
moulding memory statues within.
Phidias is the former . . . like Phidias the statuary, either moulding
in wax, or constructing by addition of a number of small stones, or
sculpturing the rough and formless stone as though by subtraction.50
The last phrase reminds one of Michelangelo, chiselling at the
formless block of marble to release the form which he has seen with-in it. So also (Bruno would seem to say) does Phidias the sculptor
of the fantasy release the forms from the inform chaos of memory.

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

There is something, to my mind, profound in the 'Phidias' Seal,
as though in this inner moulding of significant memory statues,
this drawing out of tremendous forms by subtraction of the in-essential, Giordano Bruno, the memory artist, were introducing us
to the core of the creative act, the inner act which precedes the
outer expression.
We have rather lost sight of our Elizabethan reader whom we
left some pages back wondering whether he could tackle the
Thirty Seals. How did he get on? Did he reach 'Zeuxis' and
'Phidias' ? If so he would have come upon an exposition of the
Renaissance theory of poetry and painting such as had not before
been published in England, and he would have found it in the
context of the images of occult memory.
What was the philosophy on which the magician, artist, poet,
philosopher, based the stupendous effort of the Thirty Seals ?
That philosophy is given in one phrase which comes in 'The
Husbandman' (Seal 8) who is cultivating the field of memory:
As the world is said to be the image of God, so Trismegistus does
not fear to call man the image of the world.51
Bruno's philosophy was the Hermetic philosophy; that man is the
'great miracle' described in the Hermetic Asclepius; that his mens is
divine, of a like nature with the star governors of the universe, as
described in the Hermetic Pimander. In L'idea del theatro di
Giulio Camillo we were able to trace in detail the basis in the
Hermetic writings of Camillo's effort to construct a memory
theatre reflecting 'the world', to be reflected in 'the world' of
memory.52 Bruno works from the same Hermetic principles. If
man's mens is divine, then the divine organisation of the universe
is within it, and an art which reproduces the divine organisation
in memory will tap the powers of the cosmos, which are in man
himself.
When the contents of memory are unified there will begin to
appear within the psyche (so this Hermetic memory artist believes)
the vision of the One beyond the multiplicity of appearances.
I was contemplating one knowledge in one subject. For all the
principal parts were ordained principal forms . . . and all its secon-dary forms were joined to the principal parts.53

See above, pp. 145 ff.
Op. lat., II (ii), p. 91. Bruno refers here to the De auditu kabbalistico.

254

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

So we read in 'The Fountain and the Mirror' (Seal 22). The parts
are coming together, the secondary parts are joining to the
principal parts, the frightful labours of the systems are beginning
to bear fruit, and we are beginning to contemplate 'one knowledge
in one subject'.
Here is revealed the religious aim of Bruno's memory efforts.
We are now ready for the break through to the Sigillus Sigillorum, or Seal of Seals, which corresponds to the first visionary
part of Shadows. In Shadows he began with the unified vision and
passed down from thence to the unifying processes of the memory
system. Seals reverses this order, beginning with the memory
systems and ending with the 'Seal of Seals'. I can only give an
abridged and impressionistic account of this extraordinary dis-course.
It begins with claims to divine inspiration. 'These things a
divine spirit insinuated into me.' 54 Now that we have followed the
life of the celestial gods we are ready to enter the supercelestial
circuits. And here he names the famous practitioners of the art of
memory in antiquity, Carneades, Cineas, Metrodorus55 and, above
all, Simonides, through whose beneficence all things are sought,
found and arranged.56
Simonides has been transformed into a mystagogue, one who has
taught us how to unify memory on the celestial grade and will now
introduce us to the supercelestial world.
All descends from the above, from the fountain of ideas, and to
it ascent may be made from below. 'How wonderful would be your
work if you were to conform yourself to the opifex of nature . . . if
with memory and intellect you understand the fabric of the triple
world and not without the things contained therein.'57 These
promises of conformity with the opifex of all nature recall the
words in which Cornelius Agrippa describes the Hermetic ascent
through the spheres as the experience necessary for the formation
of a Magus.58 It is to this experience that the art of memory, in its
apotheosis in the Seal of Seals, has led.

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

these extravagant pages, Bruno is still within sight of the memory
treatises in which it was quite usual to outline the faculty psycho-logy, that process by which, in the scholastic psychology, images
from sense impressions pass from the sensus communis through
other compartments of the psyche. Romberch, for example, has

OLFATUS

Romberch, Congestorium artificiose memorie
some pages on the faculty psychology, with many quotations from
Thomas Aquinas, and illustrated with a diagram of a man's
head opened to show the compartments of the faculties (Fig. 9).59
Bruno has in mind such a diagram as this, a normal ingredient of the
memory treatise, but his argument is directed against the division
of the psyche into the compartments of the faculty psychology.
These pages of his60 are a kind of manifesto of the primacy of the
59
See Romberch, Congestorium artificiosae memoriae, pp. II ff.;
Rosellius, Thesaurus artificiosae memoriae, pp. 138 ff. (also with diagram of
a man's head showing the faculties). Another treatise which gives the
faculty psychology diagram is G. Leporeus, Ars memorativa, Paris, 1520
(reproduced in Volkmann, Ars memorativa, P1. 172).

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

imagination in the cognitive process which he refuses to see as
divided among many faculties but as all one. He does distinguish
four grades of knowing (influenced here by Plotinus) namely
sense, imagination, reason, intellect, but he is careful to open the
doors between them by abolishing arbitrary divisions. And in the
end he makes it clear that in his view the whole process of cognition
is really one, and that it is, fundamentally, an imaginative process.
Looking back now at 'Zeuxis' and 'Phidias' we realise that he has
already made these statements in those Seals on the use of images
in memory. The understanding either is the fantasy or does not
exist without it, he said in 'Zeuxis'. Hence the painter or sculptor of
images in the fantasy is the only thinker, and the thinker, the artist,
and the poet are all one. 'To think is to speculate with images'
Aristotle had said, meaning that the abstracting intellect must work
from the images of sense impression. Bruno changes the meaning
of the words.61 There is for Bruno no separate faculty consisting of
the abstracting intellect; the mind works only with images, though
these images are of different degrees of potency.
Since the divine mind is universally present in the world of
nature (continues Bruno in the Seal of Seals)62 the process of
coming to know the divine mind must be through the reflection of
the images of the world of sense within the mens. Therefore the
function of the imagination of ordering the images in memory is an
absolutely vital one in the cognitive process. Vital and living images
will reflect the vitality and life of the world—and he has in mind
both magically vitalised astral images and the living and striking
images of the 'Ad Herennian' memory rule63—unify the contents of
memory and set up magical correspondencies between outer and
inner worlds. Images must be charged with affects, and particu-larly with the affect of Love,64 for so they have power to penetrate
to the core both of the outer and the inner worlds—an extraordin-ary mingling here of classical memory advice on using emotionally
charged images, combined with a magician's use of an emotionally
charged imagination, combined agàin with mystical and religious

use of love imagery. We are here within range of Bruno's Eroici
furori with its love conceits which have power to open 'the black
diamond doors' within the psyche.65
Finally, in the Seal of Seals, we reach the fifth grade of knowing
which Bruno classifies into fifteen 'contractions'.66 And here he is
talking about religious experiences, about good and bad kinds of
contemplation, about good and bad kinds of religion, about good
'magical religion' which is the best kind, though it has bad counter-feits or counterparts. I have discussed these passages in my other
book,67 pointing out that Bruno is following Cornelius Agrippa on
magical religion, though elaborating Agrippa in more extreme
directions. It is now that he makes his dangerous statements.
Thomas Aquinas is equated with Zoroaster and Paul of Tarsus
as one who had achieved one of the best kinds of 'contractions'.68
Periods of solitude and retirement are necessary for reaching
these. From the desert of Horeb, Moses produced wonders before
the Magi of Pharaoh. Jesus of Nazareth did not do his wonderful
works until after his conflict with the devil in the desert. Ramon
Lull after living the life of a hermit showed himself profound in
many inventions. Paracelsus who gloried in the title of hermit was
the inventor of a new kind of medicine.69 Contemplators among
the Egyptians, Babylonians, Druids, Persians, Mohammedans,
have achieved the higher contractions. For it is one and the same
psychic power which operates in low things and in high things,
and which has produced all the great religious leaders with
their miraculous powers.
And Giordano Bruno presents himself as such a leader, offering a
religion, or a Hermetic experience, or an inner mystery cult, the
four guides in which are Love by which souls are raised to the
divine by a divine furor; Art by which one may become joined to
the soul of the world; Mathesis which is a magical use of figures;
Magic, understood as religious magic.70 Following these guides we
may begin to perceive the four objects, the first of which is
Light.71 This is that primal light of which the Egyptians speak (he
means the passage in the Hermetic Pimander on the primal light).

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

The Chaldaeans, the Egyptians, the Pythagoreans, the Platonists,
all the best contemplators of nature ardently adored that sun,
which Plato called the image of the highest God, at whose rising
Pythagoras sang hymns, which Socrates saluted in its setting and
was seized with ecstacy.
The art of memory has become in Giordano Bruno's occult
transformation of it, a magico-religious technique, a way of becom-ing joined to the soul of the world as part of a Hermetic mystery
cult. When the Thirty Seals of memory are broken, this is the
'secret' revealed in the Seal of Seals.
A question naturally arises. Were the thirty Seals with all their
impenetrably intricate mnemonic advice a kind of barrier set up to
protect the Seal of Seals, to prevent all but the initiated from
reaching the core of the book ? Did Bruno really believe in the art
of memory in these impossible forms in which he expounded it ?
Or was it a cloak, a device for producing an incomprehensible
cloud of words under cover of which he propagated his mystery
religion ?
Such a thought comes almost as a relief, suggesting as it does an
at any rate partially rational explanation of the Seals. According to
this theory, the Seals would be meant to be fundamentally incom-prehensible presentations of every type of memory technique,
occultised, and given this title of sigilli with its magical connota-tions, to provide an impenetrable curtain of mystery intervening
between an uninitiated reader and the Seal of Seals. Many readers
attempting to study the book from the beginning would throw it
aside before they reached the end. Is that what they were meant to
do?
Though it is, I think, probable that the motive of concealment
does play a part in the arrangement of Bruno's memory books, this
is certainly not the only explanation of them. Bruno was undoub-tedly genuinely trying to do something which he thought was
possible, trying to find the arrangements of significant images
which would work as a way of inner unification. The Art 'by which
we may become joined to the soul of the world' is one of the guides
in his religion. It is not a cloak under which to conceal that
religion; it is an essential part of it, one of its main techniques.
Moreover, as we have seen, Bruno's memory efforts are not
isolated phenomena. They belong into a definite tradition, the
259

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

Renaissance occult tradition to which the art of memory in occult
forms had been affiliated. With Bruno, the exercises in Hermetic
mnemonics have become the spiritual exercises of a religion. And
there is a certain grandeur in these efforts which represent, at
bottom, a religious striving. The religion of Love and Magic is
based on the Power of the Imagination, and on an Art of Imagery
through which the Magus attempts to grasp, and to hold within,
the universe in all its ever changing forms, through images passing
the one into the other in intricate associative orders, reflecting the
ever changing movements of the heavens, charged with emotional
affects, unifying, forever attempting to unify, to reflect the great
monas of the world in its image, the mind of man. There is surely
something which commands respect in an attempt so vast in its
scope.
What kind of impression can this extraordinary work have made
upon the Elizabethan reader ?
He would have known what the art of memory in its more normal
forms was like. In the earlier years of the sixteenth century there
had been a growing lay interest in the art, as elsewhere. In Stephen
Hawes's Pastime of Pleasure (1509), Dame Rhetoric describes the
places and images, perhaps the first account of the art of memory
in English. The 1527 edition of Caxton's Mirrour of the World
contains a discussion of 'Memory Artyfycyall'. The continental
memory treatises spread to England, and an English translation
(1548) of the Phoenix of Peter of Ravenna was published.72 In the
early Elizabethan period, the memory text-book fashion is repre-sented by William Fulwood's The Castel of Memorie,73 a transla-tion of a treatise by Guglielmo Gratarolo. The third edition of this
work (1573) was dedicated to Philip Sidney's uncle, Robert
Dudley, Earl of Leicester—an indication that that Italianate
nobleman did not exclude memory from his interests. The
treatise cites Cicero, Metrodorus (mentioning his zodiacal system)
and Thomas Aquinas.
72
Quotations from Hawes and from Caxton's Mirrour on the art of
memory, and from Copland's translation of Peter of Ravenna are given in
Howell, Logic and Rhetoric in England, pp. 86–90, 95–8.
73
Cf. Howell, p. 143. The first edition of The Castel of Memorie was in
1562. It is mainly a medical treatise, like its original, with a section on
artificial memory at the end.
260

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

But in the Elizabethan world of 1583, the Protestant educational
authorities, and probably public opinion generally, were against
the art of memory. The influence of Erasmus on English humanism
was very strong, and Erasmus, as we have seen, did not encourage
the art. The Protestant educationalist, Melanchthon, who was
much admired in England, had banished the art from rhetoric. And
for the Puritan Ramists, who were extremely powerful and vocal at
this time, the imageless 'dialectical order' was the only art of
memory.
There would therefore have been strong opposition in influential
quarters in England to any attempt to reintroduce the art of
memory in its more normal forms. What, then, can have been the
reactions to the extreme occult form of the art to be found in
Seals ?
A first impression on an Elizabethan reader attempting to tackle
Seals might well have been that here was someone come back out
of the old Popish past. Both the arts of which this strange Italian
spoke, the art of memory and the Art of Lull, were old mediaeval
arts, particularly associated with the friars, the one with the Do-minicans, the other with the Franciscans. When Bruno came to
England, there were no Black Friars wandering in the streets of
London choosing places for their memory systems, like Fra
Agostino in Florence. The doctors of the modern Oxford and
Cambridge were not turning the wheels of the Lullian Art nor
memorising its diagrams. The friars had been swept away and their
great houses were expropriated or in ruins. The impression of
mediaevalism which Bruno and his Art may have given in Seals
would have been confirmed by the passages in his Italian dialogues,
published in the following year, in which he defends the friars of
the old Oxford, now despised by their successors, and deplores the
destruction of the buildings and foundations of Catholic times in
Protestant England.74
The art of memory in its mediaeval transformation had formed
an integral part of mediaeval civilisation in England, as elsewhere
in Europe.75 The English friars, with their memory 'pictures', had

261
75

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

certainly practised it.76 But although Bruno associates himself and
his art with the name of Thomas Aquinas, it is obviously not with
the mediaeval and scholastic form of the art with which Seals is
concerned, but with the Renaissance occult form. As we have seen,
in Italy the Renaissance form develops out of the mediaeval form
and is artistically enshrined in Camillo's Theatre. No such
development had taken place in England, so far as I know.
A character who never developed in England, owing to the
religious convulsions through which she passed, was the Renais-sance friar. When one thinks of Francesco Giorgio, the Venetian
Franciscan, infusing Renaissance Hermetic and Cabalist influences
into the mediaeval tradition of world harmony in his De harmonia
mundi,77 one realises that Renaissance friars such as he never
existed in England, unless possibly as characters in plays. The
English friar receded into the Gothic past, perhaps lamented by
those secretly in sympathy with that past, or feared by the super-stitious who doubted what might be the consequences of the
destruction of the old magic, but not a contemporary character,
like the Jesuit. A stay-at-home Elizabethan Englishman might well
never have met a Renaissance friar—until the wild ex-friar,
Giordano Bruno, burst suddenly upon the scene with a Hermetic
magico-religious, technique developed out of the old arts of
memory of the friars.
The only English, or rather Welsh, character who might have
acted as some preparation for the arrival of Bruno is John Dee.78
Dee was saturated in the Renaissance occult influences, and an
ardent practitioner, like Bruno, of the magical recipes in Cornelius
Agrippa's De occulta philosophia. He was also deeply interested in
the Middle Ages and a collector of the despised manuscripts of the
mediaeval past. Dee was attempting—alone and unaided and with-out the support of mystical academies such as flourished in Venice
—to effect in England that Renaissance transformation of medi-aeval traditions which belonged naturally into Italian Renaissance
'Neoplatonism'. Dee may well have been the only representative in
sixteenth-century England of the Renaissance revival of Lullism.
There were Lullist manuscripts in his library, listed promiscuously

262

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

with Pseudo-Lullian alchemical works;79 he no doubt shared the
Renaissance assumptions about Lull. And Dee is the kind of
person whom one would expect to have been interested in the
cognate subject of the art of memory in Renaissance transforma-tions.
Dee's Monas hieroglyphica80 is a sign composed out of the charac-ters of the seven planets. His excitement at his discovery of this
composite sign seems incomprehensible. It may be suggested that
his monas was perhaps, in his eyes, a unified arrangement of
significant signs, infused with astral power, which he would
believe to have a unifying effect on the psyche, composing it into a
monas or One, reflecting the monas of the world. Though Dee does
not use the places and images of the art of memory for this effort,
the assumption underlying it may be not dissimilar, as I have
suggested earlier,81 to the assumption made by Camillo when he
bases the Theatre on the images and characters of the planets, and
to Bruno's assumption that astral images and characters are potent
for unifying the memory.
It is therefore possible that those who had been trained under
John Dee, and perhaps initiated by him into the Hermetic
mysteries of the monas, would have had some idea of the kind of
thing that Bruno was driving at in his memory systems. We know
that Philip Sidney, together with his friends Fulke Greville and
Edward Dyer, chose Dee for their teacher in philosophy. It was to
Sidney that Bruno addressed himself, dedicating to him two of the
works which he published in England; and he twice mentioned
Fulke Greville by name. We do not know what Sidney thought of
Bruno; no evidence of that from Sidney's side has come down to us.
But Bruno himself speaks in terms of passionate admiration of
Sidney in his dedications, and he evidently hoped that it was by
Sidney and his circle that he would be understood.
Did Sidney wrestle with Seals one wonders ? Did he get as far
as 'Zeuxis', painting the memory images within and expounding
the Renaissance theory of ut pictura poesis? Sidney himself
79

There is a copy of Lull's Ars demonstrativa transcribed by Dee in the
Bodleian (Digby M S . 197). Several Lullian and Pseudo Lullian works are
listed in the catalogue of Dee's library; see J.O. Halliwell, Private Diary

GIORDANO BRUNO: THE SECRET OF SEALS

expounds that theory in his Defence of Poetrie—a defence of the
imagination against the Puritans—which he may have been writing
during the time that Bruno was in England.
As we have seen, Seals is very closely related to the two works
published in France, Shadows and Circe. The Ars reminiscendi in
Seals would probably have been reprinted by John Charlewood
from a copy of Circe, and much of the rest of Seals may have been
printed from unpublished manuscripts which Bruno had written in
France and brought with him to England. He states that the 'Seal
of Seals' forms part of his Clavis Magna,82 the work to which he so
frequently refers in the books published in France. Seals was there-fore, in the main, a repetition or an amplification of the 'secret'
which Bruno, successor to Giulio Camillo, had brought to a King
of France.
The French connection is kept up in the dedication of the book
to Mauvissiere, the French ambassador at whose house in London
Bruno was living.83 And the new orientation of the 'secret' towards
England is shouted aloud in the address to the Vice-Chancellor and
doctors of the University of Oxford.84 For Seals, that apotheosis of
Renaissance occult memory, was flung at Elizabethan Oxford in an
address in which the author describes himself as 'the waker of
sleeping souls, tamer of presumptuous and recalcitrant ignorance,
proclaimer of a general philanthropy'. It was in no unobtrusive or
secretive way that Bruno presented his secret to the Elizabethan
public, but in the most provocative way possible, announcing him-self as one emboldened and empowered to speak from a nonsectarian standpoint, neither Protestant nor Catholic, one with a
new message for the world. Seals was the first act of the drama of
Bruno's career in England. This is the work which must be studied
first, before the dialogues in Italian which he published later,
for it represents the mind and the memory of the Magus from
whom those works issued. The visit to Oxford, the controversy
with the Oxford doctors, the reflection of that controversy in the

moral reform and the announcement of the imminent return of
Hermetic religion in the Spaccio della bestia trionfante, the mystical
ecstacies of the Eroici furori—all these future developments are
already implicit in Seals.
In its setting in Paris, where Camillo's Theatre was remembered,
where a mystical King was leading some abstruse kind of ostensibly
Catholic religious movement, Bruno's secret had been in an
atmosphere more congenial to it than that which it encountered
when suddenly thrown, like a bomb, at Protestant Oxford.

265

Chapter XII

CONFLICT BETWEEN BRUNIAN
AND RAMIST MEMORY

I

N 1584 an extraordinary controversy broke out in England
about the art of memory. It was waged between an ardent
disciple of Bruno and a Cambridge Ramist. This debate may
be one of the most basic of all Elizabethan controversies. And
it is only now, at the point in the history of the art of memory which
we have reached in this book, that one can begin to understand
what were the issues at stake, what is the meaning of the challenge
which Alexander Dicson1 threw at Ramism from the shadows of
his Brunian art of memory, and why William Perkins angrily
retaliated with a defence of the Ramist method as the only true art
of memory.
The controversy2 opens with Dicson's De umbra rationis, which
is a close imitation of Bruno's Shadows (the title of which, De
umbris idearum, it echoes). This pamphlet, it is hardly a book, is
1

I prefer to keep Dicson's own spelling of his name, rather than
modernise it.
2
The controversy is noticed in J. L. McIntyre, Giordano Bruno,
London, 1903, pp. 35–6, and D. Singer, Bruno His Life and Thought, New
York, 1950, pp. 38–40. For new material about the life of Dicson and
valuable suggestions about the controversy, see John Durkan, 'Alexander
Dickson and S.T.C. 6823', The Bibliothek, Glasgow University Library,
III (1962), pp. 183–90. Durkan's indication of William Perkins as 'G.P.' is
confirmed by the analysis of the controversy in this chapter.
Alexander Dicson was a native of Errol in Scotland, hence the name by
which Bruno calls him, 'Dicsono Arelio'. From the traces of him found by
Durkan in various state papers it would seem that he was a secret political
agent. He died in Scotland about 1604.

CONFLICT BETWEEN BRUNIAN AND RAMIST MEMORY

dated 1583 on the title-page, but its dedication to Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester, is dated as having been written 'on the kalends of
January'. According to modern dating, therefore, this work was
published early in 1584. It elicited the Antidicsonus (1584) the
author of which styles himself 'G. P. Cantabrigiensis'. That this
'G.P. of Cambridge' was the well known Puritan divine and
Cambridge Ramist, William (Guglielmus) Perkins, will become
certain in the course of this chapter. With the Antidicsonus is
bound up another little tract in which 'G.P. of Cambridge'
further explains why he is strongly against 'the impious artificial
memory of Dicson'. Dicson came to his own defence, under the
pseudonym 'Heius Scepsius', with a Defensio pro Alexandro
Dicsono (1584). And 'G.P.' made another attack, also in 1584,
with a Libellus de memoria, followed in the same booklet by
'Admonitions to A. Dicson about the Vanity of his Artificial
Memory'.3
This controversy is waged strictly within the limits of the subject
of memory. Dicson puts out a Brunian artificial memory which to
Perkins is anathema, an impious art, against which he urges
Ramist dialectical order as the only right and moral way of memo-rising. Our most ancient friend, Metrodorus of Scepsis, plays a
prominent part in this Elizabethan fray, for the epithet 'Scepsian'
which Perkins hurls at Dicson is proudly adopted by the latter in
his defence when he styles himself 'Heius Scepsius'. In Perkins's
terminology a 'Scepsian' is one who uses the zodiac in his impious
artificial memory. The Renaissance occult memory, in its extreme
Brunian form, is at loggerheads with Ramist memory and whilst
the controversy is always ostensibly about the two opposed arts of
memory, it is at bottom a religious controversy.

The full titles of the four works in the controversy are: Alexander
Dicson, De umbra rationis, printed by Thomas Vautrollier, London,
1
583–4; 'Heius Scepsius' (i.e. A. Dicson), Defensio pro Alexandro Dicsono,
printed by Thomas Vautrollier, London, 1584; 'G. P. Cantabrigiensis',
Antidicsonus and Libellus in quo dilucide explicatur impia Dicsoni artificiosa
memoria, printed by Henry Middleton, London, 1584; 'G. P. Canta-brigiensis', Libellus de memoria verissimaque bene recordandi scientia and
Admonitiuncula ad A. Dicsonum de Artificiosae Memoriae, quam publice
profitetur, vanitate, printed by Robert Waldegrave, London, 1584.
It is not the least curious feature of the controversy that Dicson's antiRamist works are printed by the Huguenot, Vautrollier, who printed the
first Ramist works to be published in England (see Ong, Ramus, p. 301).
267

CONFLICT BETWEEN BRUNIAN AND RAMIST MEMORY

Dicson is enveloped in shadows when we first meet him in the
De umbra rationis, and they are Brunian shadows. The speakers in
the opening dialogues move in a profound night of Egyptian
mysteries. These dialogues form the introduction to Dicson's art
of memory, in which the loci are called 'subjects' and the images
'adjuvants' or more frequently 'umbra'.4 Clearly he is using
Bruno's terminology. He repeats the 'Ad Herennian' rules for
places and images, but muffled in an obscure mystique, after the
Brunian manner. The 'umbra' or image is as a shadow of the light of
the divine mind which we seek through its shadows, vestiges,
seals.5 The memory is to be based on the order of the signs of the
zodiac which are repeated,6 though Dicson does not repeat the
list of the images of the decans. Traces of Bruno's list of inventors
are to be discerned in the advice that Theutates may stand for
letters; Nereus for hydromancy; Chiron for medicine, and so on;7
though the full list of Bruno's inventors is not given. Dicson's art of
memory is but a fragmentary impression of the systems and ex-positions of Shadows from which it is nevertheless unmistakably
derived.
The opening dialogues are the most prominent feature of the
work, being nearly as long as the Brunian art of memory which
they introduce. They are obviously inspired by those at the
beginning of Shadows. It will be remembered that Bruno intro-duces Shadows with the conversation between Hermes who
produces the book 'on the shadows of ideas' as a way of inner
writing; Philothimus who welcomes it as an 'Egyptian' secret; and
Logifer, the pedant, whose cackle is likened to animal noises and
who despises the art of memory.8 Dicson varies this personnel
slightly. One of his speakers is the same, namely Mercurius
(Hermes). The others are Thamus, Theutates, and Socrates.
Dicson has in mind the passage in Plato's Phaedrus which I
quoted in an earlier chapter,9 in which Socrates tells the story of
the interview between the Egyptian King, Thamus, and the wise
Theuth who had just invented the art of writing. Thamus says

that the invention of writing will not improve memory but destroy
it, because the Egyptians will trust in these 'external characters
which are not part of themselves' and this will discourage 'the use
of their own memory within them'. This argument is closely
reproduced by Dicson in the conversation of his Thamus and
Theutates.
The Mercurius of Dicson's dialogue is a different character
from his Theutates; and this at first seems strange for Mercurius
(or Hermes) Trismegistus is usually identified with Thoth-Hermes
the inventor of letters. But Dicson follows Bruno in making
Mercurius the inventor, not of letters, but of the 'inner writing'
of the art of memory. He thus stands for the inner wisdom which
Thamus says that the Egyptians lost when external writing with
letters was invented. For Dicson, as for Bruno, Mercurius
Trismegistus is the patron of Hermetic, or occult, memory.
In the Phaedrus, it is Socrates who tells the story of Thamus'
reaction to the invention of letters. But in Dicson's dialogue,
Socrates has become the cackling pedant, the superficial person
who cannot understand the ancient Egyptian wisdom of the
Hermetic art of memory. It has been suggested,10 and I am sure
rightly, that this superficial and pedantic Greek is meant as a
satire on Ramus. This would fit in with theRamistprioscatheologia,
in which Ramus is the reviver of the true dialectic of Socrates.11
Dicson's Socrates-Ramus would be the teacher of a superficial and
false dialectical method, whilst his Mercurius is the exponent of a
more ancient and better wisdom, that of the Egyptians as repre-sented in the inner writing of occult memory.
Once the origin and meaning of the four speakers is grasped, the
dialogue which Dicson puts into their mouths becomes under-standable—or at least understandable within its own peculiar
terms of reference.
Mercurius says that he sees a number of beasts before him.
Thamus says that he sees men, not beasts, but Mercurius insists
that these men are beasts in human forms, for the true form of
man is the mens and these men, through neglecting their true form
have fallen into the forms of beasts and come under the 'punish-ments of matter' (vindices materiae). What do you mean by these
10

269

CONFLICT BETWEEN BRUNIAN AND RAMIST MEMORY

punishments of matter, asks Thamus? To which Mercurius
replies:
It is the duodenarius, driven out by the denarius.12
This is a reference to the thirteenth treatise of the Corpus Hermeticum where is described the Hermetic regenerative experience in
which the soul escapes from the domination of matter, described
as twelve 'punishments' or vices, and becomes filled with ten
powers or virtues.13 The experience is an ascent through the spheres
in which the soul casts off the bad or material influences reaching
it from the zodiac (the duodenarius), and ascends to the stars
in their pure form, without the contamination of material influences,
where it is filled with the powers or virtues (the denarius) and sings
the hymn of regeneration. This is what Mercurius means in
Dicson's dialogue when he says that the 'duodenarius' of immer-sion in matter and in beast-like forms is to be driven out by the
'denarius' when the soul becomes filled with divine powers in
the Hermetic regenerative experience.
Thamus now describes Theutates as a beast, at which Theutates
strongly protests. 'You calumniate, Thamus... the use of letters, of
mathematics, are these the work of beasts ?' Whereupon Thamus
replies, closely in the word of Plato's story, that when he was in the
city called Egyptian Thebes men were writing in their souls with
knowledge, but Theutates has since sold them a bad aid for
memory by inventing letters. This has brought in superficiality and
quarrelling and made men little better than beasts.14
Socrates comes to the defence of Theutates, praising his great
invention of letters and defying Thamus to prove that when men

passionate invective against Socrates as a sophist and a liar. He has
taken away all criteria of truth, reducing wise men to the level of
boys, malicious in disputing; he knows nothing of God and does
not seek him in his vestiges and shadows in the fabrica mundi; he

have seen Lazzarelli's Crater Hermetis which describes t h e passing
of a H e r m e t i c regenerative experience from a master to a disciple. 2 1
W h e n M e r c u r i u s cites passages from t h e Hermetica h e is of
course quoting supposedly his own works. H e is speaking as
M e r c u r i u s T r i s m e g i s t u s , t h e teacher of t h e ancient Egyptian
wisdom in t h e H e r m e t i c writings. A n d this same M e r c u r i u s is h e
w h o teaches t h e 'inner writing' of t h e occult memory. B r u n o ' s
disciple makes a b u n d a n t l y clear what we have already realised
from B r u n o ' s o w n m e m o r y works, t h a t t h e art of m e m o r y as h e
taught it was very closely associated with a H e r m e t i c religious
cult. T h e t h e m e of Dicson's most curious dialogues is t h a t t h e
inner writing of t h e art of m e m o r y represents Egyptian profundity
a n d spiritual insight, carries with it Egyptian regenerative ex-periences as described by Trismegistus, and is t h e antithesis of t h e
beast-like m a n n e r s , t h e Greek frivolity a n d superficiality, of those
w h o have n o t h a d t h e H e r m e t i c experience, have n o t achieved t h e
gnosis, have not seen t h e vestiges of t h e divine in the fabrica mundi,
have not become one with it b y reflecting it within.
So strong is Dicson's abhorrence of supposedly Greek charac-teristics that h e even denies t h a t t h e Greek Simonides invented t h e
art of m e m o r y . I t was t h e Egyptians w h o invented it. 2 2
T h i s work m a y b e of importance altogether disproportionate to
its size. F o r Dicson makes it even clearer t h a n B r u n o himself does
that Brunian m e m o r y implied a H e r m e t i c cult. Dicson's art of
m e m o r y is only a n impressionistic reflection of Shadows. T h e
important t h i n g in his little work is t h e dialogues, expanded from
t h e dialogues in Shadows, in which there are verbal quotations
from t h e H e r m e t i c regeneration treatises. H e r e are unmistakable

The sixteenth treatise of the Corpus Hermeticum was not included in
Ficino's Latin translation of the first fourteen treatises which Dicson was
probably using. It was first published in the Latin translation of Lazza-relli in 1507.1 have suggested (G.B. and H. T., pp. 263–4) that Bruno knew
this treatise.

and Demonic Magic, pp. 64–72; G.B. and H.T., pp. 171–2, etc.

In the art of memory which follows the dialogues, Dicson states that
'he of Chius', that is Simonides of Ceos, is falsely thought to have been the
inventor of the art which originally came from Egypt. 'And if it is separated
from Egypt it can effect nothing.' He adds that it may have been known to
the Druids. (De umbra rationis, p. 37).

T h e probability that Dicson's Socrates is a satirical portrait of
R a m u s is increased b y t h e fact that t h e cap fitted a n d that ' G . P . of
C a m b r i d g e ' was goaded into defence of R a m u s a n d attack on t h e
impious artificial m e m o r y of Dicson. I n t h e dedication to T h o m a s
Moufet of his Antidicsonus, Perkins states that there are two kinds
of arts of m e m o r y , one using places a n d ' u m b r a ' , t h e other b y
logical disposition as taught b y R a m u s . T h e former is utterly
v a i n ; t h e latter is t h e only t r u e m e t h o d . Ostentatious m e m o r i o graphers such as M e t r o d o r u s , Rossellius, N o l a n u s , a n d Dicsonus
m u s t b e repelled a n d one m u s t adhere as to a column to t h e faith
of Ramist m e n . 2 3
N o l a n u s — h e r e is t h e n a m e that matters. Giordano Bruno of
Nola w h o t h e year before h a d flung his Seals at Oxford was t h e real
initiator of this debate. Perkins sees h i m as in alliance with
M e t r o d o r u s of Scepsis a n d with Rossellius, Dominican author of a
m e m o r y treatise. H e is also clearly aware of Dicson's connection
with B r u n o t h o u g h h e makes, so far as I can see, n o references in
t h e Antidicsonus to Bruno's works on m e m o r y , b u t directs himself
solely against t h e work of t h e disciple, t h e De umbra rationis of
Alexander Dicson.
H e says t h a t Dicson's L a t i n style is obscure a n d does n o t smell
of ' R o m a n p u r i t y ' . 2 4 T h a t his use of the celestial signs in m e m o r y is
absurd. 2 5 T h a t all such nonsense should b e t h r o w n out for logical
disposition is t h e sole discipline for m e m o r y , as R a m u s teaches. 2 6
T h a t Dicson's soul is blind a n d i n error knowing nothing of t h e
t r u e a n d t h e good. 2 7 T h a t all his images a n d ' u m b r a e ' are utterly
vain for i n logical disposition you have a natural power for
remembering.
Perkins's arguments are t h r o u g h o u t full of reminiscences of
R a m u s a n d frequently h e quotes verbally from his master, giving
references. ' O p e n your ears', h e cries to Dicson, ' a n d hear t h e words
of R a m u s speaking against you, a n d recognise t h e i m m e n s e river
of his genius.' 2 8 H e t h e n quotes from t h e Scholae dialecticae o n t h e

R a m u s ' usual pronouncements on logical order as t h e basis of
m e m o r y ; 3 0 t h e second is another passage comparing Ramist
m e m o r y to t h e classical art to t h e disadvantage of t h e latter:
Whatever of art may help the memory is the order and disposition
of things, the fixing in the soul of what is first, what second, what
third. As to those places and images which are vulgarly spoken of
they are inept and rightly derided by any master of arts. How many
images would be needed to remember the Philippics of Demos-thenes ? Dialectical disposition alone is the doctrine of order; from
it alone can memory seek aid and help. 3 1
T h e Antidicsonus is followed b y t h e Libellus in quo dilucide
explicatur impia Dicsoni artificiosa memoria in which Perkins goes
t h r o u g h t h e ' A d H e r e n n i a n ' rules, which Dicson h a d quoted,
opposing to t h e m in detail t h e Ramist logical disposition. A t one
point in this somewhat dreary process Perkins becomes very
interesting, a n d indeed unintentionally funny. T h i s is where h e is
speaking of Dicson's 'animation' of t h e m e m o r y images. Dicson
h a d of course b e e n talking in his obscure Brunian fashion of t h e
classical rule t h a t images m u s t b e striking, active, unusual, a n d
able to stir t h e m e m o r y emotionally. Perkins thinks that t h e use of
such images is n o t only vastly inferior intellectually to logical
disposition b u t is also morally reprehensible, for such images m u s t
arouse t h e passions. A n d here h e mentions Peter of Ravenna w h o
in his book on artificial m e m o r y has suggested the use of libidinous
images to t h e y o u n g . 3 2 T h i s m u s t refer to Peter's remarks on h o w
h e used his girl friend, J u n i p e r of Pistoia, as an image sure to
stimulate his m e m o r y since she was so dear to h i m w h e n y o u n g . 3 3
Perkins holds u p P u r i t a n h a n d s of horror at such a suggestion
which actually aims at arousing b a d affects to stimulate m e m o r y .
S u c h an art is clearly n o t for pious m e n , b u t has been m a d e u p b y

aseptic. M e m o r i s i n g lines of Ovid t h r o u g h logical disposition
would help to sterilise t h e disturbing affects aroused b y t h e

T h e other work against Dicson by Perkins, published in t h e same
year 1584, is t h e Libellus de memoria verissimaque bene recordandi
scientia which is another exposition of Ramist m e m o r y with m a n y
examples of logical analysis of passages of poetry a n d prose t h r o u g h
which these are to b e memorised. I n an epistle before t h e work,
Perkins gives a brief history of t h e classical art of m e m o r y , invented
by Simonides, perfected b y M e t r o d o r u s , expounded b y Tullius
and Quintilian, a n d i n m o r e recent times b y Petrarch, Peter of
Ravenna, Buschius, 3 4 Rossellius. W h a t does it all a m o u n t to ? asks
Perkins. T h e r e is n o t h i n g wholesome or learned in it, b u t rather it
smells of ' s o m e k i n d of barbarism and Dunsicality'. 3 5 T h i s is
interesting w i t h its use of t h e word 'Dunsicality', recalling t h a t
cry of ' D u n s e s ' used b y extreme Protestants against those of t h e
old Catholic order, a w o r d which stimulated t h e bonfires of
Dunsical manuscripts w h e n t h e Reformers were clearing out t h e
monastic libraries. F o r Perkins t h e art of m e m o r y has a mediaeval
smell; its exponents do not speak with a ' R o m a n p u r i t y ' ; it belongs
to the old times of barbarism and Dunsicality.
T h e Admonitions to Alexander Dicson which follow r u n o n t h e
same lines as t h e Antidicsonus t h o u g h with m o r e detailed attention
to t h e 'astronomy' o n which Dicson bases m e m o r y a n d which
Perkins shows to b e false. T h e r e is an important reaction against
astrology h e r e w h i c h deserves careful study. Perkins is making a
rational a t t e m p t to u n d e r m i n e t h e 'Scepsian' artificial m e m o r y
by attacking t h e astrological assumptions on which it is based.
However, t h e impression of rationality which Perkins makes in
these pages is somewhat clouded w h e n we find that t h e chief
reason w h y it is w r o n g to use 'astronomy' in m e m o r y is because t h e
former is a 'special' art whereas m e m o r y as a part of dialecticrhetoric is a 'general' art. 3 6 H e r e Perkins is blindly following t h e
arbitrary Ramist reclassification of t h e arts.

T o w a r d s t h e e n d of t h e Admonitions t h e matter is s u m m e d u p in
a passage in w h i c h Dicson is adjured to compare his artificial
m e m o r y with t h e Ramist m e t h o d . T h e m e t h o d records in m e m o r y
t h r o u g h a natural order, b u t your artificial m e m o r y , Dicson, has
been artificially m a d e u p b y Greeklings. T h e m e t h o d uses t r u e
places, p u t t i n g generals in t h e highest place, subalterns in t h e
m i d d l e place, specials in t h e lowest. But in your art what kind are
t h e places, t r u e or fictitious ? If you say that they are t r u e , you l i e ;
if you say t h a t they are fictitious I shall not disagree with you since
you thereby cover your art with o p p r o b r i u m . I n t h e m e t h o d , t h e
images are clear a n d distinct and clearly divided, n o t fugitive
shadows as in your art. ' H e n c e t h e palm is given to t h e m e t h o d over
that broken a n d weak discipline of m e m o r y . ' 3 7 T h e passage is
interesting evidence of h o w t h e m e t h o d was developed out of t h e
classical art yet was basically opposed to it on t h e fundamental
point of images. U s i n g t h e terminology of t h e classical art, Perkins
t u r n s it against t h e classical art and applies it to t h e m e t h o d .
Dicson's Defensio pro Alexandro Dicsono is chiefly remarkable
for t h e p s e u d o n y m 'Heius Scepsius' u n d e r which h e published
it. T h e ' H e i u s ' m a y refer to his m o t h e r ' s m a i d e n n a m e of H a y . 3 8
T h e 'Scepsius' is certainly an enrolment u n d e r t h e b a n n e r of
M e t r o d o r u s of Scepsis—and of Giordano B r u n o — w h o use t h e
zodiac in m e m o r y .
T h i s controversy abundantly confirms Ong's view that t h e
Ramist m e t h o d was primarily a m e t h o d for memorising. Perkins
rests his position t h r o u g h o u t on t h e assumption that t h e Ramist
m e t h o d is an art of m e m o r y with which, like R a m u s himself, h e
compares unfavourably t h e classical art, n o w to b e discarded and
superseded. Perkins also confirms t h e suggestion m a d e in t h e last
chapter that t h e Brunian type of artificial m e m o r y would have
looked in Elizabethan England like a mediaeval revival. Dicson's
art suggests t h e past to Perkins, t h e old bad times of ignorance and
Dunsicality.
I t is because t h e opponents think of their respective methods as
arts of m e m o r y t h a t their warfare is waged entirely in terms of
m e m o r y . Yet there are obviously other implications in this battle
over m e m o r y . Both sides think of their respective arts of m e m o r y
as moral a n d virtuous, and truly religious, whilst that of their

superficial Greece, or, to p u t it t h e other way r o u n d , superstitious
a n d ignorant Egypt and reformed P u r i t a n Greece, have different
arts of m e m o r y . T h e one is a 'Scepsian' a r t ; t h e other is t h e
Ramist method.
Proof of the identity of 'G.P.' is found in t h e fact that in his
Prophetica, a work published u n d e r his o w n n a m e in 1592, William
Perkins makes an attack o n t h e classical art of m e m o r y o n lines
similar to those developed b y ' G . P . ' . T h e Prophetica has been
defined b y Howell as t h e first work b y a n Englishman which
applies t h e Ramist m e t h o d to preaching, and Howell also notes
that Perkins here ordains that t h e Ramist m e t h o d is to b e used
for memorising sermons, n o t t h e artificial m e m o r y w i t h places
and images. 3 9 T h e passage against artificial m e m o r y is as follows:
T h e artificial memory which consists in places and images will
teach how to retain notions in memory easily and without labour.
But it is not to be approved (for the following reasons). I. T h e
animation of the images which is the key of memory is impious:
because it calls up absurd thoughts, insolent, prodigious and the
like which stimulate and light up depraved carnal affections. 2. It
burdens the mind and memory because it imposes a triple task on
memory instead of one; first (the remembering of) the places; then
of the images; then of the thing to be spoken of.40
W e can recognise in these words of Perkins, t h e Puritan preacher,
t h e ' G . P . ' w h o wrote against t h e impious artificial m e m o r y of
Dicson a n d w h o deplored t h e libidinous images r e c o m m e n d e d b y
Peter of Ravenna. T h e whirligig of time has transformed t h e
mediaeval T u l l i u s , who used to work so h a r d at forming memorable

and there is t h e greatest need to see that such idols are given u p
a n d all r e m n a n t s of t h e former idolatry destroyed wherever this
has n o t yet b e e n done. I n addition t o urging active iconoclasm,
Perkins also warns against t h e theory underlying religious images.
' T h e Gentiles said that images erected were elements or letters
to knowe G o d b y : so say t h e Papists, that Images are Laiemens
bookes. T h e wisest among t h e Gentiles used images a n d other
ceremonies to p r o c u r e t h e presence of angels a n d celestiall powers
that b y t h e m they might attaine to t h e knowledge of G o d . T h e like
doe t h e Papists w i t h images of Angels a n d Saints.' 4 3 But this is
forbidden, for 'we m a y not binde t h e presence of G o d , t h e opera-tion of his spirit, a n d his hearing of us to any thing, to which G o d
h a t h n o t b o u n d himselfe . . . N o w G o d h a t h not b o u n d himself by
any w o r d to b e present at images.' 4 4
M o r e o v e r t h e prohibition against images applies within as
well as without. ' S o soone as t h e m i n d e frames u n t o it selfe any
forme of G o d (as w h e n h e is popishly conceiued to b e like an old
m a n sitting in h e a u e n in a t h r o n e with a sceptre in his h a n d ) an
idol is set u p in t h e m i n d e . . . ' 4 5 T h i s prohibition is to b e applied
to any u s e of t h e imagination. ' A thing faigned in t h e m i n d b y
imagination is a n idol.' 4 6
W e have to picture t h e controversy between Perkins a n d Dicson
against t h e background of ruined buildings, smashed a n d defaced
images—a background which loomed ever present in Elizabethan
England. W e m u s t recreate t h e old mental habits, t h e art of
m e m o r y as practised from time immemorial using t h e old build-ings a n d t h e old images reflected within. T h e 'Ramist m a n ' m u s t
smash t h e images b o t h within a n d without, m u s t substitute for t h e
old idolatrous art t h e n e w image-less way of remembering t h r o u g h
abstract dialectical order.
A n d if t h e old mediaeval m e m o r y was wrong, what of Renais-sance occult m e m o r y ? Occult m e m o r y moves in a direction
diametrically opposed to Ramist m e m o r y , stressing beyond all
measure that use of t h e imagination which t h e other prohibited,
stressing it into a magical power. Both sides think of their o w n

Oxford. B r u n o a n d Dicson between t h e m took on b o t h t h e
universities. Dicson's dispute with a Cambridge Ramist was
paralleled b y Bruno's dispute with t h e Aristotelians of Oxford in
that visit to Oxford t h e results of which are reflected in his Cena de
le ceneri published in 1584, t h e year of t h e Dicson-Perkins contro-versy. T h o u g h there were some Ramists in Oxford, it was n o t a
stronghold of R a m i s m like Cambridge. A n d t h e Oxford doctors
who objected to Bruno's exposition of Ficinian magic in a context
of Copernican heliocentricity were not Ramists, for in t h e satire
on t h e m in t h e Cena they are called Aristotelian pedants. Ramists
were, of course, anti-Aristotelian. I have recounted elsewhere t h e

Bruno reveals in t h e dedication to t h e F r e n c h ambassador of his
De la causa, principio e uno, also published in this exciting year of
1584, that great commotions were going on a r o u n d h i m . H e is

envy of t h e ignorant, t h e p r e s u m p t i o n of sophists, t h e detraction

T h e first dialogue of t h e De la causa, t h o u g h opening with a
vision of t h e s u n of t h e N o l a n ' s n e w philosophy, is also full of
reports of t h e upheavals. Eliotropio (whose n a m e recalls t h e

(possibly a version of H e r m e s ) 5 0 tell Filoteo, t h e philosopher
(Bruno himself) that there has been m u c h adverse c o m m e n t on his
Cena de le ceneri. Armesso hopes t h a t t h e n e w work ' m a y not
become t h e subject of comedies, tragedies, lamentations, dialogues
and w h a t not similar to those which appeared a little while ago a n d

said that h e has taken too m u c h u p o n himself in a country which is
not his own. T o which t h e philosopher replies t h a t it is a mistake to
kill a foreign doctor because h e is trying cures which are u n k n o w n

replies t h a t it is t h e divine inspiration which h e feels within. 'Few

disciple Dicsono supports his master throughout, asking t h e right
questions for eliciting his wisdom, and earnestly agreeing with all
that h e says.
T h u s in t h e heated atmosphere of 1584 Bruno himself proclaims
Alexander Dicson as his disciple. T h e excited Elizabethan public is
r e m i n d e d t h a t ' N o l a n u s ' and 'Dicsonus' belong together, t h a t
Dicson's De umbra rationis is b u t t h e voice of B r u n o expounding
t h e same mysterious 'Scepsian' art of m e m o r y as was to b e found in
Shadows a n d Seals a n d which belongs with t h e N o l a n ' s H e r m e t i c
philosophy.
Since t h e art of m e m o r y h a d become such a r e d - h o t subject, it
was somewhat daring of T h o m a s Watson, poet a n d m e m b e r of t h e
Sidney circle, to publish in about 1585 or perhaps earlier, a Com-pendium memoriae localis. T h i s seems a perfectly straight exposition
of t h e classical art as a rational mnemotechnic, giving t h e rules
with examples of their own application. A n d i n his preface,
Watson is careful to disassociate himself from B r u n o a n d Dicson.
I very much fear if my little work (nugae meae) is compared with the
mystical and deeply learned Sigilli of the Nolan, or with the
Umbra artificiosa of Dicson, it may bring more infamy on the
author than utility to the reader. 64
Watson's book shows that t h e classical art was still popular with
poets, a n d to p u b l i s h a 'local m e m o r y ' at this time a m o u n t e d to
taking u p a position against Puritan Ramism. H e was also perfectly
aware, as his preface shows, that Bruno and Dicson were conceal-ing other matters in their arts of memory.
W h e r e did Philip Sidney, t h e leader of t h e Elizabethan poetic
Renaissance, stand amidst all these controversies ? F o r Sidney, as is
well k n o w n , was closely identified with Ramism. Sir William
T e m p l e , a very p r o m i n e n t m e m b e r of t h e Cambridge school, was
his friend, a n d in t h a t same fateful year of 1584 w h e n t h e ' S c e p sians' a n d t h e Ramists were at loggerheads over m e m o r y , T e m p l e
dedicated to Sidney his edition of R a m u s ' s Dialecticae libri duo. 65

CONFLICT BETWEEN BRUNIAN AND RAMIST MEMORY
A very curious problem is raised b y t h e interesting piece of
information which D u r k a n has unearthed in his article o n Alex-ander Dicson. Searching the state papers for references to Dicson,
D u r k a n found this in a letter from Bowes, t h e English representa-tive at t h e Scottish court, to L o r d Burghley, dated 1592:
Dickson, master of the art of memory, and sometime attending on
Mr. Philip Sidney, deceased, has come to court. 66
I t is very striking that L o r d Burghley's correspondent knows h o w
best to r e m i n d t h a t statesmen (who knew everything) of w h o
Dicson is. A master of t h e art of m e m o r y w h o formerly attended
Philip Sidney. W h e n could Dicson have been in attendance o n
Sidney ? Presumably in those years around 1584 w h e n h e m a d e
himself conspicuous as a master of t h e art of m e m o r y , a n d t h e
disciple of t h a t other master of t h e art, Giordano B r u n o .
T h i s scrap of new evidence brings Sidney a little closer to
B r u n o . If B r u n o ' s disciple was in attendance on h i m , Sidney can-not have been altogether averse to B r u n o himself. W e have h e r e
for t h e first t i m e a h i n t that B r u n o h a d some justification for
dedicating t o Sidney (in 1585) his Eroici furori a n d his Spaccio
della bestia trionfante.
H o w t h e n did Sidney balance himself between influences so
opposite as those of t h e Ramists and of t h e Bruno-Dicson school
of t h o u g h t ? Perhaps b o t h were competing for his favour. T h e r e
m a y b e some slight evidence for this suggestion in a r e m a r k b y
Perkins in his dedication to T h o m a s Moufet, w h o was a m e m b e r of
Sidney's circle, of his Antidicsonus. Perkins says in this dedicatory
letter t h a t h e hopes t h a t Moufet will assist h i m in repelling t h e
influence of t h e 'Scepsians' and of t h e 'School of D i c s o n ' . 6 7
T h e Sidney w h o was t h e disciple of J o h n D e e , w h o allowed
Alexander Dicson to b e in attendance on h i m , to w h o m B r u n o
felt that h e could dedicate his works, does not quite fit with Sidney

conciliating these opposite influences. N o p u r e Ramist could have
written t h e Defence of Poetrie, t h e defence of t h e imagination
against t h e Puritans, the manifesto of t h e English Renaissance.
N o r could a p u r e Ramist have written this Sonnet to Stella:
Though dusty wits dare scorn astrology,
And fools can think those lamps of purest light
Whose numbers, ways, greatness, eternity,
Promising wonders, wonder do invite
T o have for no cause birthright in the sky
But for to spangle the black weeds of Night;
Or for some brawl, which in that chamber hie,
They should still dance to please the gazer's sight.
For me, I do Nature unidle know,
And know great causes great effects procure;
And know those bodies high reign on the low.
And if these rules did fail, proof makes me sure,
Who oft fore-see my after following race,
By only those two eyes in Stella's face.
T h e poet is following t h e way of t h e sky with religious feeling,
like T h a m u s , t h e Egyptian king in Dicson's dialogue; h e is h u n t i n g
after t h e vestiges of t h e divine in n a t u r e , like B r u n o in t h e Eroici
furori. A n d if t h e attitude to t h e old art of m e m o r y with places
a n d images can b e taken as a touchstone, Sidney alludes to it in a
way which is not hostile. Speaking in t h e Defence of Poetrie of h o w
verse is m o r e easily r e m e m b e r e d t h a n prose, h e says:
. . . they that have taught the art of memory have showed nothing
so apt for it as a certain room divided into many places, well and
throughly known; now that hath the verse in effect perfectly, every
word having his natural seat, which seat must needs make the word
remembered. 68
T h i s interesting adaptation of local m e m o r y shows that Sidney did
not memorise poetry b y t h e Ramist m e t h o d .
T h e N o l a n left these shores in 1586 b u t his disciple continued to
teach t h e art of m e m o r y in England. I derive this information
from H u g h Piatt's The Jewell House of Art and Nature, published
at L o n d o n in 1592. Platt speaks of ' t h e A r t of M e m o r i e which

whereof h e h a t h written a figurative a n d obscure treatise.' 6 9 Platt
took lessons of Dicson a n d learned to memorise places in sets of
ten with images on t h e m which were to b e m a d e lively a n d active, a
process which 'Maister Dickson tearmed to animate t h e umbras (sic)

initiated into H e r m e t i c mysteries.
Dicson's 'figurative a n d obscure' treatise on m e m o r y , with its
dialogues in w h i c h H e r m e s Trismegistus quotes from his o w n
works, seems t o have h a d a considerable circulation. I t was re-printed with t h e t i d e Thamus in 1597 b y T h o m a s Basson, an
English printer settled at L e i d e n ; Basson also reprinted in t h e same

was interested i n reprinting these works. T h i s printer liked mys-teries a n d was probably a m e m b e r of t h e secret sect, t h e Family of

W

H E N Bruno arrived back in Paris in 1586, having
crossed the Channel with Mauvissiere, t h e F r e n c h

t h e K i n g of F r a n c e from his throne.
I n this troubled and dangerous town, Bruno did not fear to

himself (in t h e Cena de le ceneri) as having given to t h e Aristotelian
doctors at Oxford. T h e speech in t h e Collège de Cambrai opposes
t h e philosophy of t h e living universe, infused with t h e divine life,

Aristotelici physici auditus3 which teaches h o w to memorise the
physics of Aristotle t h r o u g h a series of mythological m e m o r y
images which are to b e placed on a curious looking place system.
Memorising t h e physics of Aristotle by t h e artificial m e m o r y
evidently belonged into t h e D o m i n i c a n tradition because R o m berch, in that useful m e m o r y Congestion of his, tells t h e following
story:
A young man, almost ignorant of this art (of memory), depicted on
walls some rather inane little figures through which he could go
through in order the De auditu physico of Aristotle; and though
his simulachra did not accord very well with the matter, they helped
him to remember it. If such weak aids yet help memory, how
much more will it be helped if its foundation is improved by
use and exercise. 4
H e r e is t h e exact title which B r u n o uses for a c o m p e n d i u m of
Aristotelian physics, De auditu physico, and here is a friar recount-ing h o w it might b e memorised b y t h e artificial m e m o r y , which is
what Bruno p u r p o r t s to b e doing.
I say advisedly ' p u r p o r t s to b e doing', for there is something
peculiar here. W h y does h e want us to memorise t h e dead and
e m p t y Aristotelian physics ? W h y are we n o t u r g e d to draw into
m e m o r y t h e living powers of t h e divine universe t h r o u g h magically
animated images ? A n d it m a y b e t h a t this is what t h e book is
really about. Mythological figures are to b e used as t h e m e m o r y
images, t h e Arbor Olympica, Minerva, T h e t i s as matter, Apollo as
form, t h e 'superior P a n ' as n a t u r e , C u p i d as motion, S a t u r n as
time, Jupiter as t h e p r i m e mover, a n d so on. 5 Such forms as these,
animated with t h e magic of divine proportions, would contain
Bruno's philosophy, would themselves b e t h e imaginative means
of grasping it. A n d w h e n we see that the place system 6 on which t h e
images are to b e placed (P1. 14c) is one of those horoscope-like
diagrams such as are to b e seen in Seals we realise that t h e images
are supposed to b e magically animated, magically in contact with
cosmic powers. A n d indeed t h e connection with Seals is stated at

the Seal of t h e Painter, perhaps that of the Sculptor. 7
T h e m e m o r y system by which the physics is to b e 'figured' is in
itself a contradiction of the physics. T h e book is a Seal, t h e
counterpart of his anti-Aristotelian attack on the Parisian doctors,
just as, in England, Seals was the counterpart of his attack on t h e
Oxford doctors. Zeuxis or Phidias, painting or sculpturing
t r e m e n d o u s and significant images within t h e m e m o r y , represent
Bruno's way of understanding the living world, of grasping it
t h r o u g h t h e imagination.

illustrate B r u n o ' s philosophy. T h e y are his philosophy, showing
forth t h e power of t h e imagination to grasp t h e universe t h r o u g h
images. T h e series begins with t h e 'infigurable' concepts after
which come t h e figured Statues.
W i t h i n this series, Bruno presents his philosophical religion, his
religious philosophy. T h e infigurable ORCUS or ABYSS signifies t h e
infinite desire a n d need for the divine infinity, t h e thirst for t h e
infinite, 9 as in B r u n o ' s De l'infinito universo e mondi. T h e figurable
APOLLO as h e rides by, standing naked in his chariot, his head
n i m b e d with solar rays, is t h e MONAD or the O N E , 1 0 t h e central s u n
towards which all B r u n o ' s unifying efforts are directed, SATURN
follows, brandishing his sickle, as the Beginning or T i m e .

PROMETHEUS, devoured b y t h e vulture, is t h e Causa efficiens11 (these
three Statues contain t h e t h e m e of Bruno's De la causa, principio, e

direction of t h e intention towards an object 1 2 (as in t h e mystical
aspirations of B r u n o ' s De gli eroici furori). COELIUS signifies t h e
natural goodness as expressed in t h e order of nature, t h e symmetry
of t h e stars, t h e natural order of heaven directed towards a good
e n d , 1 3 Bruno's search in t h e fabrica mundi for t h e vestiges of t h e
divine. VESTA signifies moral goodness, that which tends to t h e good
of h u m a n society, B r u n o ' s insistence on social ethics a n d philan-thropy. T h r o u g h VENUS a n d her son CUPID we seek t h e unifying

religion of Love a n d Magic.

Bruno's religion. S h e is t h e continuity of h u m a n reason with
divine a n d demonic intelligences, representing Bruno's belief in

impressive of Bruno's writings, in which h e can b e so clearly seen

innovating i n this work b u t reviving something of very great
antiquity, calling back again

theologians who used not so much to veil the arcana of nature in
types and similitudes as to declare and explain them digested in a
series and more easily accomodated to memory. We easily retain a

of memory fabulous fictions; therefore (through them) we shall be
able without difficulty to consider and retain mysteries, doctrines,
and disciplinary intentions . . . as in nature we see vicissitudes of
light and darkness so also there are vicissitudes of different kinds
of philosophies. Since there is nothing new . . . it is necessary to
return to these opinions after many centuries. 16
T h e r e are three lines of thinking in this passage which B r u n o has
amalgamated into one.
I t alludes first of all to the theory of t h e m y t h s a n d fables of t h e
ancients as containing within t h e m t r u t h s of natural a n d moral
philosophy. T h e Renaissance text-book which explained in h a n d y
form the natural and moral truths contained in t h e m y t h s was, of
course, t h e Mythologia of Natalis Comes. B r u n o certainly knew
C o m e s ' work a n d is drawing o n it in Statues, t h o u g h t h e philo-sophy in t h e Statues is his own philosophy. H e believes that h e is
drawing out of t h e m y t h s t h e t r u e ancient philosophy which h e is
reviving.
But B r u n o introduces m e m o r y into his theory of mythology. H e
reverses t h e usual statement, t h a t t h e ancients concealed arcana in
t h e m y t h s , w h e n h e says that, o n t h e contrary, they declared a n d
explained t r u t h s t h r o u g h t h e m y t h s in order to make t h e m m o r e
easily r e m e m b e r e d . T h e n comes an echo of T h o m i s t and Domini-can theory about t h e art of m e m o r y , t h a t t h e 'sensibilia' are m o r e
easily retained in m e m o r y t h a n t h e 'intelligibilia' and that therefore
we m a y use in m e m o r y the 'corporeal similitudes' advised b y
Tullius because these will help us to direct spiritual intentions
towards intelligible things. Bruno's D o m i n i c a n training has
impressed t h e T h o m i s t theorising of t h e art of m e m o r y towards
religious a n d spiritual intentions most deeply on his m i n d . T h e
Statues are all said to contain ' i n t e n t i o n s ' ; they express n o t only
t h e natural a n d moral t r u t h b u t t h e intention of t h e soul towards it.
T h o u g h Bruno's theory a n d practice of m e m o r y was radically
different from t h a t of T h o m a s Aquinas, it was only out of t h e
religious use of t h e image in m e m o r y t h a t t h e Brunian t y p e of
transformation of t h e art of m e m o r y into t h e discipline of his
religion could have taken place.
Finally, w h e n B r u n o speaks of vicissitudes of light a n d darkness
a n d of t h e light n o w r e t u r n i n g with h i m , h e always means t h e

H e r m e t i c or 'Egyptian' philosophy and t h e magical religion of t h e
Egyptians w h o , as described in t h e H e r m e t i c Asclepius, knew h o w
to make statues of the gods t h r o u g h which to draw down celestial
a n d divine intelligences. T h e m e m o r y statues are intended to have
in t h e m this magical power, applied inwardly. T h e r e are m a n y
magical a n d talismanic touches in t h e descriptions of t h e m . 1 7
Camillo interpreted t h e magic of t h e statues of the Asclepius as a
magic of artistic proportion, a n d so, perhaps, we m a y think of
Phidias t h e Sculptor as a 'divine' artist of the Renaissance as h e
moulds in B r u n o ' s m e m o r y t h e great figures of the gods.
T h e Statues would thus have for Bruno a three-fold p o w e r ; as
ancient a n d t r u e statements in mythological form of t h e ancient
a n d t r u e philosophy a n d religion which h e believes that h e is
reviving; as m e m o r y images containing within t h e m intentions of
t h e will towards grasping these t r u t h s ; as artistically magic m e m o r y
images t h r o u g h which t h e M a g u s believes that h e puts himself in
contact with 'divine' and demonic intelligences'.
As a Brunian m e m o r y system, Statues belongs recognisably
within t h e whole complex of t h e m e m o r y works. I t confirms t h e
interpretation of t h e Figuration of Aristotle as containing within its
m e m o r y system t h e refutation of the Aristotelian philosophy which
it is supposed to memorise, 1 8 for m a n y of t h e mythological figures
of t h e Figuration are t h e same as those in Statues,
T h e T h i r t y Statues are, I believe, supposed to b e revolved on
Lullian combinatory wheels. T h e system, w h e n completed (as
already mentioned the manuscript is incomplete) would have
represented one of Bruno's frightful efforts to combine t h e
classical art of m e m o r y with Lullism b y putting images, instead of
letters, on t h e combinatory wheels. Bruno wrote several Lullian
works whilst at Wittenberg with which t h e T h i r t y Statues probably
connect, 1 9 for it is noticeable t h a t in Statues B r u n o is using
concepts taken from t h e principia a n d relata of Lullism. A
revolving system using thirty mythological figures is given
17

See G.B. and H.T., p. 310.
There may here be an interesting anticipation of Francis Bacon's
use of mythology as a vehicle for conveying an anti-Aristotelian philo-sophy; see Paolo Rossi, Francesco Bacone, Bari, 1957, pp. 206 ff.
19
The titles of these works, De lampade combinatoria lulliana and De
progressu et lampade venatoria logicorum obviously connect with the title
Lampas triginta staturum. Cf. G.B. and H.T., p. 307.

in Shadows (the Lycaon to Glaucus series) 2 0 which is probably
t h e g e r m out of which the m o r e ambitious system of Statues
developed.
T h e Figuration and Statues are not full Brunian m e m o r y trea-tises. T h e y are examples of how to use the Seals Zeuxis the Painter
or Phidias t h e Sculptor b y basing m e m o r y on mythological
images which (1) contain t h e Brunian philosophy; (2) u p o n which
imagination a n d will are directed with strong intentions; (3) which
are believed to b e astralised or magicised into images which, like
t h e magic statues of t h e Asclepius, will attract celestial or demonic
powers into t h e personality.
William Perkins was absolutely right in seeing t h e B r u n o Dicson artificial m e m o r y in a context of Catholic versus Pro-testant attitude to images. F o r whilst B r u n o , t h e heretical M a g u s
of M e m o r y could (and did) develop out of pious mediaeval use of
t h e images of t h e art of m e m o r y , t h e Protestant inner and outer
iconoclasm arrested t h e possibility of any such development.
Bruno's last book on m e m o r y was t h e last work which h e
published, just before h e r e t u r n e d to Italy, to t h e prisons of t h e
Inquisition a n d eventual death at t h e stake. T h e invitation sent to
h i m from Venice b y t h e m a n w h o wished to learn his m e m o r y
secrets precipitated this return. I n this book, therefore, B r u n o is
p r o p o u n d i n g his m e m o r y secrets for t h e last time. T h e book is
called De imaginum signorum et idearum compositione21 and will
henceforth b e referred to as Images. I t was published at Frankfort
in 1591, b u t was probably mainly written in Switzerland, perhaps
at t h e castle near Zurich of J o h a n n Heinrich Hainzell, an occultist
a n d alchemist with w h o m Bruno stayed for a time and to w h o m t h e
book is dedicated.
T h e book is in three parts. T h e third a n d last p a r t consists of
' T h i r t y Seals'. As in Seals, published eight years previously in
England, Bruno is here listing various types of occult m e m o r y
systems. M a n y of these are t h e same as in t h e English Seals with
t h e same titles, b u t these latest Seals are, if possible, even m o r e
obscure t h a n t h e earlier ones. T h e L a t i n verses in which some of
t h e m are described have affinities with t h e L a t i n poems which

developments in these latest Seals, particularly in t h e elaboration
of pseudo-mathematical, or 'mathesistical', place systems. A
great difference between these G e r m a n Seals a n d t h e English
Seals is that they do n o t lead u p to a 'Seal of Seals' revealing t h e
religion of Love, Art, Mathesis, a n d M a g i c as t h e English series
did. I t seems to have been only in England t h a t B r u n o m a d e that
revelation so explicitly in a p r i n t e d work.
T h e T h i r t y Seals published i n G e r m a n y , with their connections
with t h e L a t i n poems published in G e r m a n y , would form a vital
point of departure for t h e study of Bruno's influence in Ger-m a n y , just as t h e English Seals, with their connections with t h e
Italian dialogues published i n England, are vital for his influence
in England. T h i s book is mainly directed towards his influence in
England a n d I therefore d o n o t a t t e m p t further discussion here of
t h e T h i r t y Seals in t h e t h i r d part of Images. Something m u s t b e
said, however, of t h e first two parts of t h e book in which B r u n o
grapples once again with his eternal p r o b l e m of images a n d
presents a n e w m e m o r y system.
T h e first part is a n art of m e m o r y in which (as in t h e arts i n
Shadows a n d Circe, t h e latter reprinted in Seals) B r u n o goes
t h r o u g h t h e ' A d H e r e n n i a n ' rules b u t in a yet m o r e mystifying form
t h a n hitherto. Moreover h e n o w speaks, n o t of a n art b u t of a
m e t h o d . ' W e institute a m e t h o d , n o t about things b u t about t h e
significance of t h i n g s . ' 2 3 H e begins with rules for i m a g e s ; dif-ferent ways of forming m e m o r y i m a g e s ; images for things a n d
images for w o r d s ; that images m u s t b e lively, active striking,
charged with emotional affects so t h a t they m a y pass t h r o u g h t h e
doors of t h e storehouse of m e m o r y . 2 4 Egyptian a n d Chaldaean
mysteries are hinted at, yet b e n e a t h all t h e verbiage t h e m e m o r y
treatise structure is clearly visible. I think t h a t h e is mainly using
R o m b e r c h . W h e n in t h e chapter o n 'images for w o r d s ' h e says that
t h e letter O m a y b e represented b y a s p h e r e ; t h e letter A b y a
ladder or compasses; t h e letter I b y a column, 2 5 h e is simply

The De immenso, innumerabilibus et infigurabilibus; the De triplici
minimo et mensura; the De monade numero et figura. The imagery in these
poems connects with Statues and Images in ways too complex to begin to
investigate here.

describing in words one of the visual alphabets illustrated by
Romberch.
H e then passes to rules for places (this is t h e wrong order, rules
for places should come first) and here also the m e m o r y treatise
foundation is obvious. Sometimes h e breaks into Latin verse which
sounds most impressive b u t which R o m b e r c h helps one to con-strue.
Complexu numquam vasto sunt apta locatis
Exiguis, neque parva nimis maiora receptant.
Vanescit dispersa ampla de sede figura,
Corporeque est modico fugiens examina visus.
Sint quae hominem capiant, qui stricto brachia ferro
Exagitans nihilum per latum tangat et altum. 26
W h a t can this m e a n ? I t is t h e rule that m e m o r y loci should not be
too large nor too small, with t h e addition in the last two lines of
R o m b e r c h ' s advice t h a t a m e m o r y locus should not b e higher nor
wider t h a n a m a n can reach, t h e rule which R o m b e r c h illustrates
(see Fig. 3).
I n association with t h e art of m e m o r y in this first part of Images
B r u n o presents an architectural m e m o r y system of terrible
complexity. By an 'architectural' system I m e a n that this is a
system using sequences of memory rooms in each of which m e m o r y
images are to b e placed. T h e architectural form is, of course, t h e
most normal form of t h e classical art of memory b u t Bruno is using
it in a highly abnormal way in which t h e distribution of t h e
m e m o r y rooms is involved with magical geometry a n d t h e system
is worked from above b y celestial mechanics. T h e r e are twentyfour 'atria' or rooms each divided into nine m e m o r y places with
images on t h e m . T h e s e 'atria' with their nine divisions are
illustrated in diagrammatical form on pages of the text. T h e r e are
also fifteen 'fields' in the system, each divided into nine places; and
thirty 'cubicles', which bring t h e system within range of t h e
' t h i r t y ' obsession.
O n e has to get hold of t h e general idea that everything in this
lower world is supposed to b e memorised t h r o u g h t h e images in
these atria, fields, a n d cubicles. Everything in t h e physical world is
to b e here, all plants, stones, metals, animals, birds, and so on (Bruno

makes use for his encyclopaedic classifications of t h e alphabetical
lists to b e found i n t h e m e m o r y text books). Also every art, science,
invention k n o w n to m a n , a n d all h u m a n activities. B r u n o states
that t h e atria a n d fields which h e teaches h o w t o erect will include
all things which can b e said, known, or imagined.
A large o r d e r ! B u t we are used to this kind of thing. T h i s is a n
encyclopaedic m e m o r y system like t h e one i n Shadows in which all
the contents of t h e world, all arts a n d sciences known t o m e n ,
were supposed to b e included o n t h e wheels surrounding t h e
central wheel with its celestial images. N e i t h e r I n o r t h e reader are
M a g i , b u t w e can at least get h o l d i n a general way of the idea that
all the material which—in t h e system of Shadows—was shown on t h e
inventors' wheel a n d t h e other wheels s u r r o u n d i n g t h e central
magic images wheel is n o w distributed i n a system of m e m o r y
rooms. T h i s is a n architectural 'Seal' full of correspondences,
associative orders, which are b o t h m n e m o n i c a n d astral.
But where is t h e celestial system t h r o u g h which alone an
encyclopaedic occult m e m o r y like this could work ? T h e celestial
system is in t h e second part of Images.
I n this second p a r t 2 7 there appear before us twelve tremendous
figures or 'principles' which are said to b e t h e causes of all things,
u n d e r t h e 'ineffable a n d infigurable O p t i m u s M a x i m u s ' . T h e s e are
JUPITER (with J u n o ) , SATURN, MARS, MERCURY, MINERVA, APOLLO,
AESCULAPIUS (with Circe, Arion, O r p h e u s ) , SOL, LUNA, VENUS,CUPID,

TELLUS (with Ocean, N e p t u n e , Pluto). T h e s e are t h e celestial ones,
t h e great statues of t h e cosmic gods. W i t h these m a i n figures,
Bruno arranges large n u m b e r s of talismanic or magic images,
presumably t o assist in drawing their powers into t h e psyche. I
have analysed this series a n d its associated images i n m y other
book, 2 8 pointing o u t that B r u n o is here applying t h e Ficinian
tahsmanic magic t o m e m o r y images, probably with t h e idea of
drawing particularly strong Solar, Jovial, a n d Venereal influences
into t h e personality of t h e kind of M a g u s which h e aspires t o b e .
T h e s e figures form t h e celestial system of Images, inner statues
magically assimilated t o t h e influences of t h e stars.

Probably a diagram (P1. 14d) is the 'Sea' which expresses the
system as a whole. It represents, we are told, the arrangement of
the twenty-four atria, the memory rooms each with their loci filled
with images. Each individual atrium, and the plan of the atria as a
whole, is said to have a relationship to the four points of the
compass. The circle surrounding the square plan of the memory
rooms represents, I believe, the heavens. On it would be inscribed
the celestial figures and images, the round celestial system animat-ing, organising, unifying, the infinite detail of the contents of the
lower world memorised in the places and images of the system of
memory rooms.
This diagram should, then, represent the memory building of the
system in Images as a whole, a round building representing the
heaven with a square lay-out inside it, a building reflecting the
upper and the lower worlds in which the world as a whole is
remembered from above, from the unifying, organising, celestial
level. Perhaps this system carries out the suggestion in Seal 12 of
Seals, where Bruno says that 'he knows a double picture' for
memory,29 one the celestial memory with astral images, the other
by 'feigning as need requires edifices'. This system would be using
the 'double picture' simultaneously, combining the round celestial
system with the square system composed of the memory rooms.
We now notice the lettering on the central circle of the diagram,
which is nowhere explained in the text (and which is not repro-duced accurately in the nineteenth-century edition of this work).
Perhaps we are becoming bewitched or bemused but do the letters
on that circle begin to read as 'Alta Astra' ? Is this the memory
temple of an astral religion ?
A very much simpler use of classical architectural memory
adapted to a Renaissance use is to be discerned in Campanella's
City of the Sun. The Città del Sole30 is, of course, primarily a
Utopia, the description of an ideal city, the religion of which is a
solar or astral cult. The city is round, with a round temple in its
centre on which are said to be depicted all the stars of heaven with
29

See above, p. 249
The Città del Sole was written by Campanella in about 1602 when he
was in the prisons of the Inquisition in Naples. It was first published in a
Latin version in 1623. On the City of the Sun and its affinities with
Bruno's ideas, see G.B. and H.T., pp. 367 ff.

their relationships to things here below. T h e houses of t h e city are
arranged as circular walls, or giri, concentric with t h e central
circle in which is t h e temple. O n these walls are said to b e depicted
all mathematical figures, all animals, birds, fishes, metals, and so on;
all h u m a n inventions a n d activities; a n d o n t h e outermost circle
or wall are statues of great m e n , great moral and religious leaders
a n d founders of religions. T h i s is the kind of encyclopaedic lay-out
of a universal m e m o r y system, with a 'celestial' organising basis,
with which B r u n o has m a d e us very familiar. A n d Campanella
repeatedly stated t h a t his City of t h e S u n , or perhaps some m o d e l
of it, could b e used for 'local m e m o r y ' , as a very quick way of
knowing everything 'using the world as a book'. 3 1 Clearly t h e City
of the S u n w h e n used as 'local m e m o r y ' would b e a fairly simple
Renaissance m e m o r y system, one in which the classical principle of
memorising places in buildings has been adapted to worldreflecting uses, after t h e Renaissance m a n n e r .
T h e City of t h e S u n , which is a U t o p i a n city based on an astral
religion, w h e n used as a m e m o r y system may b e usefully compared
with B r u n o ' s systems, b o t h the one in Shadows a n d t h e one in
Images. I t is m u c h simpler t h a n Bruno's systems because static in a
City (as Camillo's system is static in a T h e a t r e ) and does not
a t t e m p t Bruno's awful complexities. Nevertheless if we compare
t h e 'Alta Astra' on the r o u n d central altar of t h e Images system with
t h e r o u n d temple at t h e centre of the City of the S u n , certain basic
similarities between 'local m e m o r y ' as conceived b y B r u n o and
Campanella, b o t h of w h o m were trained in t h e Dominican convent
at Naples, m a y become apparent.
' T o think is to speculate with images', says Bruno again in
Images,32 misinterpreting Aristotle as h e h a d done in Seals.
N o w h e r e is his overwhelming preoccupation with the imagination
m o r e apparent t h a n in this his last work which contains t h e most
painfully complex of all his systems and his last thoughts about
images. Working with two traditions about t h e use of images, t h e

T h e conviction that it is within, in t h e inner images which are
nearer to reality t h a n t h e objects of t h e outer world, t h a t reality is
grasped a n d t h e unified vision achieved, underlies t h e whole. Seen
in t h e light of an inner s u n , t h e images merge a n d fuse into t h e
vision of t h e O n e . T h e religious impulse which moves B r u n o in his
stupendous m e m o r y efforts is nowhere m o r e apparent t h a n in
Images. T r e m e n d o u s is t h e force of t h e 'spiritual intentions' w h i c h
h e directs u p o n his inner images, a n d this force is a legacy from t h e
mediaeval transformation of t h e classical art of m e m o r y , however
strangely changed in this its latest Renaissance transformation
into an A r t which is one of t h e disciplines of a H e r m e t i c or
'Egyptian' religion.

France. T h o u g h neither L a m b e r t Schenkel nor his disciple
Johannes P a e p p were of t h e same calibre as Giordano B r u n o , they
are w o r t h y of attention as post-Brunian m e m o r y teachers w h o
knew something about Bruno's version of artificial m e m o r y .
L a m b e r t Schenkel 3 3 (1547 to circa 1603) was a rather celebrated
person in his day, w h o attracted attention b y public exhibitions of
his powers of m e m o r y a n d b y his published works. His origins
appear to have b e e n in t h e Catholic L o w C o u n t r i e s ; h e studied at
Louvain a n d his first book on m e m o r y , De memoria, was published
at D o u a i in 1593, w h i c h w o u l d seem to give it t h e approval of that
intensely Catholic centre of Counter-Reformation activities. 3 4
However, doubts about Schenkel seem to have arisen a n d h e was
later accused of magic. H e charged fees for his lessons a n d t h e
aspirer after learning t h e secrets of m e m o r y was obliged to consult
h i m personally, for t h e full secrets were not, so h e said, revealed in
his books.
Schenkel's chief work o n m e m o r y is his
Gazophylacium,
published at Strasburg in 1610 a n d in a F r e n c h translation at Paris
i n 1623. 3 5 I t is mainly based o n his earlier De memoria t h o u g h with
elaborations a n d additions.
W i t h t h e Gazophylacium we are in t h e stream of t h e R o m b e r c h
a n d Rossellius type of m e m o r y text-book, and Schenkel is
very consciously trying to attach himself to t h e D o m i n i c a n
m e m o r y tradition t h r o u g h his constant quotations from T h o m a s
Aquinas as t h e great expert o n m e m o r y . H e gives a long history
of t h e art of m e m o r y in t h e first p a r t of t h e book, mentioning all
t h e usual n a m e s , Simonides of course, M e t r o d o r u s of Scepsis,
T u l l i u s , a n d so on, a n d in m o d e r n times Petrarch, and so on, add-i n g to t h e usual lists of m o d e r n names m a n y others w h o m h e

There seems to have been a good deal of interest in a revival of the
art of memory in the Catholic Low Countries, judging by the impassioned
oration in favour of the art of Simonides made at Louvain in 1560 and
published as N . Mameranus, Oratio pro memoria et de eloquentia in

historian of t h e art of m e m o r y w h o , if h e cares to look u p S c h e n kel's references, m a y b e led to a good deal of useful material.
W h a t Schenkel teaches appears to b e in n o way u n u s u a l ; it is
basically t h e classical art, with long sections on places, giving
diagrams of rooms containing m e m o r y places, a n d long sections on
images. I t could b e a rational mnemotechnic which Schenkel is
teaching t h o u g h in t h e elaborated forms in which it h a d become
involved in t h e m e m o r y treatises. But h e is very obscure and h e
mentions some rather suspect authors, such as T r i t h e m i u s .
Schenkel h a d a disciple a n d imitator, one Johannes P a e p p . T h e
works on m e m o r y of this P a e p p are deserving of rather careful
attention because h e plays a rôle which m a y b e vulgarly described
as letting t h e cat out of t h e bag. H e , as h e describes it, 'detects
Schenkel' or reveals t h e secret of t h e occult m e m o r y h i d d e n in
Schenkel's books. T h i s purpose is stated in t h e title of his first
book, Schenkelius
detectus: seu memoria artificialis
hactenus
occultata, published at Lyons in 1617. A n d h e continued t h e good
work of 'detecting Schenkel' in two subsequent publications. 3 6
T h e tell-tale P a e p p mentions a n a m e which Schenkel never
mentions, J o r d a n u s B r u n u s , 3 7 a n d t h e secret which h e reveals
seems to b e somewhat of a Brunian nature.
P a e p p has been a careful student of Bruno's works, particularly
of Shadows from which h e quotes several times. 3 8 A n d his long lists
of magic images to b e used as m e m o r y images are very reminiscent
of those in Images. Arcane philosophical mysteries, says P a e p p , are
contained in t h e art of m e m o r y . 3 9 T h e r e is nothing of t h e strange
philosophical and visual power of B r u n o in his little books, b u t h e
gives in a curious passage one of t h e clearest indications t h a t I have
found of h o w t h e texts o n classical and scholastic m e m o r y could

After q u o t i n g from t h e Summa ( I I , 2, 49) of T h o m a s Aquinas
t h e famous t r e a t m e n t of memory, and emphasising what T h o m a s
says of order in m e m o r y , h e immediately follows on to a quotation
from ' t h e fifth sermon of Trismegistus in P i m a n d e r ' . H e is using
Ficino's Pimander, his L a t i n translation of t h e Corpus Hermeticum,
t h e fifth treatise of which is on ' G o d who is b o t h apparent a n d
inapparent 5 . I t is a rhapsody on t h e order of t h e universe as a
revelation of G o d a n d o n t h e H e r m e t i c experience in which,
t h r o u g h contemplation of this order, G o d is revealed. N e x t h e
passes to a quotation from t h e Timaeus, a n d thence to Cicero in
De oratore o n placing in order as t h e best aid to m e m o r y , and to
Ad Herennium (which h e still assumes to b e by Cicero) on t h e art of
m e m o r y as consisting in an order of places and images. Finally h e
returns to t h e rule of Aristotle a n d T h o m a s that frequent medita-tion helps m e m o r y . 4 0 T h e passage shows a transition from t h e
places a n d images of t h e artificial m e m o r y to t h e order of t h e
universe ecstatically perceived as a religious experience b y
'Trismegistus'. T h e sequence of quotations and ideas here shows
t h e thought-sequence t h r o u g h which t h e places and images of t h e
T u l l i a n a n d T h o m i s t artificial m e m o r y became a technique for
imprinting t h e universal world order on memory. Or, in other
words, how t h e techniques of artificial m e m o r y t u r n e d into t h e
magico-religious techniques of t h e occult memory.
I t is a secret of t h e Renaissance which P a e p p is still revealing in
t h e early seventeenth century, for t h e fifth treatise of Trismegistus
is q u o t e d in Camillo's L'Idea del Theatro. 41 But it has reached h i m
via G i o r d a n o B r u n o .
Schenkel a n d his indiscreet disciple confirm what we have
already guessed, t h a t m e m o r y teaching with an occult side passed

H e r m e t i c religious message, or a H e r m e t i c sect. T h e y also show u s ,
by contrast, w h a t genius and power of imagination Bruno infused
into material which, w h e n treated b y a Schenkel or a P a e p p , sinks
back to the m e m o r y treatise level. G o n e n o w are t h e visions of a

GIORDANO BRUNO: LAST WORKS ON MEMORY
W h a t are we to make of t h e extraordinary sequence of Giordano
Bruno's works on m e m o r y ? T h e y all belong closely together, are
all interlocked with one another. Shadows and Circe in F r a n c e ,
Seals in England, t h e Figuration on the second visit to F r a n c e ,
Statues in G e r m a n y , Images t h e last published work before t h e
fatal r e t u r n to Italy—are they all traces of the passage t h r o u g h
E u r o p e of a p r o p h e t of a n e w religion transmitting messages in a
code, t h e m e m o r y code ? Was all the intricate m e m o r y advice, were
all t h e various systems, barriers erected to confuse the uninitiated
b u t indicating to the initiated that behind all this there was a 'Seal
of Seals', a H e r m e t i c sect, perhaps even a politico-religious
organisation ?
I have d r a w n attention i n m y other book to the r u m o u r that
B r u n o was said to have founded a sect in G e r m a n y called t h e
'Giordanisti', 4 2 suggesting that this might have something to do
with the Rosicrucians, t h e mysterious b r o t h e r h o o d of t h e Rosy
Cross announced b y manifestos in t h e early seventeenth century in
G e r m a n y , about which so little is known that some scholars argue
that it never existed. W h e t h e r or n o t there is any connection
between t h e r u m o u r e d Rosicrucians a n d t h e origins of Free-masonry, first heard of as an institution in England in 1646 w h e n
Elias Ashmole was m a d e a mason, is again a mysterious and unset-tled question. B r u n o , at any rate, propagated his views in b o t h
England a n d G e r m a n y , so his movenents might conceivably b e a
c o m m o n source for b o t h Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. 4 3 T h e
origins of Freemasonry are w r a p p e d in mystery, t h o u g h supposed to
derive from mediaeval guilds of 'operative' masons, or actual
builders. N o one has been able to explain h o w such 'operative'
guilds developed into 'speculative' masonry, t h e symbolic use of
architectural imagery in masonic ritual.
T h e s e subjects have been t h e h a p p y h u n t i n g - g r o u n d of wildly
imaginative and uncritical writers. I t is time that they should b e
investigated with proper historical a n d critical m e t h o d s and t h e r e
are signs that that time is approaching. I n the preface to a book o n
t h e genesis of Freemasonry it is stated that the history of masonry
ought not to b e regarded as something apart b u t as a b r a n c h of
social history, a study of a particular institution and t h e ideas
underlying it 'to b e investigated a n d written in exactly t h e same

way as t h e history of other institutions'. 4 4 O t h e r m o r e recent books
on t h e subject have been moving in t h e direction of exact historical
investigation, b u t t h e writers of such books have to leave as an
unsolved question t h e problem of t h e origin of 'speculative'
masonry, with its symbolic use of columns, arches, and other
architectural features, and of geometrical symbolism, as t h e frame-work within which it presents a moral teaching and a mystical
outlook directed towards t h e divine architect of t h e universe.
I would think t h a t t h e answer to this problem may b e suggested
by the history of t h e art of m e m o r y , that t h e Renaissance occult
m e m o r y , as w e have seen it in Camillo's T h e a t r e and as it was
fervently propagated b y Giordano Bruno, may b e t h e real source
of a H e r m e t i c a n d mystical m o v e m e n t which used, not t h e real
architecture of 'operative' masonry, b u t t h e imaginary or 'specula-tive' architecture of the art of m e m o r y as t h e vehicle of its
teachings. A careful examination of t h e symbolism, b o t h of
Rosicrucianism a n d of Freemasonry, might eventually confirm
this hypothesis. S u c h an investigation does not belong within t h e
scope of this book, t h o u g h I will point to some indications of the
lines on which it might b e conducted.
T h e supposedly Rosicrucian manifesto or Fama of 1614 speaks
of mysterious rotae or wheels, and of a sacred 'vault' t h e walls,
ceiling a n d floor of which was divided into compartments each
with their several figures or sentences. 4 5 T h i s could b e something
like an occult use of artificial m e m o r y . Since for Freemasonry
there are n o records until m u c h later, t h e comparison here would
b e with masonic symbolism of the late seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries and particularly, perhaps, with t h e symbolism of that
b r a n c h of masonry known as the 'Royal A r c h ' . Some of the old
prints, banners, and aprons of Royal A r c h masonry, with their
designs of arches, columns, geometrical figures and e m b l e m s , 4 6
look as t h o u g h they might well be in t h e tradition of occult memory.

T h a t tradition would have been entirely forgotten, hence t h e gap
in t h e early history of masonry.
T h e advantage of this theory is that it provides a link between
later manifestations of t h e Hermetic tradition in secret societies
a n d t h e m a i n Renaissance tradition. F o r w e have seen t h a t
Bruno's secret h a d been a m o r e or less open secret in t h e earlier
Renaissance w h e n Camillo's T h e a t r e was such a widely publicised
p h e n o m e n o n . T h e secret was t h e combination of t h e H e r m e t i c
beliefs with t h e techniques of t h e art of m e m o r y . I n t h e early
sixteenth century this could b e seen as belonging naturally into a
Renaissance tradition, t h a t of t h e 'Neoplatonism' of Ficino a n d
Pico as it spread from Florence to Venice. I t was an example of t h e
extraordinary impact of t h e H e r m e t i c books on t h e Renaissance,
t u r n i n g m e n ' s m i n d s towards t h e fabrica mundi, t h e divine
architecture of t h e world, as an object of religious veneration and a
source of religious experience. I n the later sixteenth century, t h e
m o r e troubled age in which Bruno passed his life, t h e pressures of
t h e times, b o t h political and religious, m a y have been driving t h e
'secret' m o r e and m o r e u n d e r g r o u n d , b u t to see in B r u n o only t h e
propagator of a secret society (which h e may have been) would b e to
lose his full significance.
F o r his secret, t h e H e r m e t i c secret, was a secret of t h e whole
Renaissance. As h e travels from country to country with his
'Egyptian' message Bruno is transmitting t h e Renaissance in a very
late b u t a peculiarly intense form. T h i s m a n has to t h e full t h e
Renaissance creative power. H e creates inwardly t h e vast forms of
his cosmic imagination, and w h e n h e externalises these forms in
literary creation, works of genius spring to life, t h e dialogues which
h e wrote in England. H a d h e externalised in art t h e statues w h i c h
h e moulds in m e m o r y , or t h e magificent fresco of t h e images of t h e
constellations which he paints in t h e Spaccio della bestia trionfante,
a great artist would have appeared. But it was Bruno's mission to
paint and m o u l d within, to teach that t h e artist, t h e poet, and t h e
philosopher are all one, for t h e M o t h e r of t h e M u s e s is M e m o r y .
N o t h i n g comes out b u t what has first been formed within, and it is
therefore within that the significant work is done.
W e can see that the tremendous force of image-forming which h e
teaches in t h e arts of m e m o r y is relevant to Renaissance imagina-tive creative force. But w h a t of t h e frightful detail with which h e
expounds those arts, t h e revolving wheels of t h e Shadows system

charged, n o t in general b u t in detail, with the contents of t h e worlds
of n a t u r e a n d of m a n , or t h e even more appalling accumulations of
m e m o r y rooms in t h e system in Images? Are these systems
erected solely as vehicles for passing on the codes or rituals of a
secret society ? O r , if Bruno really believed in t h e m , surely they are
t h e work of a m a d m a n ?
T h e r e is u n d o u b t e d l y , I think, a pathological element in the
compulsion for system-forming which is one of Bruno's leading
characteristics. B u t what an intense striving after m e t h o d there is
in this m a d n e s s ! B r u n o ' s m e m o r y magic is n o t t h e lazy magic of
t h e Ars notoria, t h e practitioner of which just stares at a magical
nota whilst reciting magical prayers. W i t h untiring industry h e
adds wheels to wheels, piles m e m o r y rooms on m e m o r y r o o m s .
W i t h endless toil h e forms t h e innumerable images which are to
stock t h e s y s t e m s ; endless are t h e systematic possibilities a n d they
m u s t all b e tried. T h e r e is in all this what can only b e described as
a scientific element, a presage on t h e occult plane of the pre-occupation w i t h m e t h o d of t h e next century.
F o r if M e m o r y was t h e M o t h e r of the M u s e s , she was also to b e
t h e M o t h e r of M e t h o d . R a m i s m , Lullism, t h e art of memory—all
those confused constructions c o m p o u n d e d of all t h e m e m o r y
m e t h o d s w h i c h crowd t h e later sixteenth a n d early seventeenth
centuries—are s y m p t o m s of a search for m e t h o d . Seen in t h e
context of this growing search or urge, it is n o t so m u c h t h e mad-ness of B r u n o ' s systems as their uncompromising determination
to find a m e t h o d which seems significant.
A t t h e e n d of this a t t e m p t to make a systematic study of Bruno's
works o n m e m o r y , I would emphasise that I do not claim to have
fully u n d e r s t o o d t h e m . W h e n later investigators have discovered
m o r e about t h e almost u n k n o w n a n d unstudied subjects with
which this book attempts to deal, t h e t i m e will b e ripe for reaching
a fuller u n d e r s t a n d i n g of these extraordinary works, a n d of t h e
psychology of occult m e m o r y , t h a n I have been able to achieve.
W h a t I have tried to d o , as a necessary preliminary for under-standing, is to attempt to place t h e m in some kind of a historical
context. I t was t h e mediaeval art of m e m o r y , with its religious a n d
ethical associations, which B r u n o transformed into his occult
systems which seem to m e to have, possibly, a triple historical

THE

art of m e m o r y as h e conceived it is inseparable from
Bruno's t h o u g h t a n d religion. T h e magical view of
n a t u r e is t h e philosophy which makes possible t h e
magical power of t h e imagination to make contact with
it, and t h e art of m e m o r y as transformed b y Bruno was t h e
instrument for making this contact t h r o u g h t h e imagination. I t was
t h e inner discipline of his religion, t h e inner means by which h e
sought to grasp a n d unify t h e world of appearances. Moreover, as
in Camillo's theatre t h e occult m e m o r y was t h o u g h t of as giving
magical power to t h e rhetoric, so Bruno aspired to infuse his words
with power. H e wished to act u p o n t h e world as well as to reflect it, as
h e p o u r e d forth in poetry or prose his H e r m e t i c philosophy of n a t u r e
a n d t h e H e r m e t i c or 'Egyptian' religion which h e associated with it
a n d of which h e prophesied in England t h e i m m i n e n t r e t u r n .
W e would therefore expect to find that t h e patterns of the occult
m e m o r y as w e have studied t h e m in t h e m e m o r y works will b e
traceable in all Bruno's writings, a n d particularly in those for
which h e is most widely k n o w n — t h a t fascinating series of dia-logues in Italian 1 which h e wrote in t h e house of t h e F r e n c h
ambassador in L o n d o n , s u r r o u n d e d by t h e tumults which h e so
vividly describes.

As mentioned above (see p. 294) I am excluding discussion of Bruno's
Latin poems, published in Germany, which ought also to be examined in
relation to his memory systems, using the version of the 'Thirty Seals'
which he published in Germany.

I n t h e Cena de le ceneri or 'Ash Wednesday S u p p e r ' , published
in England in 1584, is reflected Bruno's visit to Oxford a n d his
clash with t h e Oxford doctors over his Ficinian or magical version
of Copernican heliocentricity. 2 T h e dialogues have a topographical
setting w h i c h takes t h e form of a journey t h r o u g h t h e streets of

A t last they arrive. Curious incidents occur b u t they are

interpretation of Copernican heUocentricity in a m a n n e r very

themes of t h e debate at t h e ' S u p p e r ' . 'To t h e last of t h e R o m a n
places you m a y a d d t h e first of the Parisian places', h e says in one
of his m e m o r y books. 8 I n t h e Cena de le ceneri, h e is using ' L o n d o n
places', t h e S t r a n d , Charing Cross, t h e T h a m e s , t h e F r e n c h
embassy, a h o u s e in Whitehall, on which to r e m e m b e r t h e themes
of a debate a b o u t t h e S u n at a Supper, themes which certainly have
occult significances relating in some way to t h e r e t u r n of magical
religion heralded b y t h e Copernican Sun.
Just before B r u n o begins his account of t h e ' S u p p e r ' a n d t h e
events leading u p to it, h e calls on M e m o r y to aid h i m :
And thou, Mnemnosyne mine, who art hidden beneath the thirty
seals and immured within the dark prison of the shadows of ideas,
let me hear thy voice sounding in my ear.
Some days ago there came two messengers to the Nolan from a
gentleman of the court. They informed him that this gentleman
was very desirous of having some conversation with him in order to
hear his defence of the Copernican theory and of other paradoxes
included in his new philosophy. 9
A n d t h e n begin t h e expositions of Bruno's 'new philosophy'
combined with t h e confused account of t h e journey to t h e ' S u p p e r '
a n d of t h e debate t h e r e w i t h t h e 'pedants' about t h e S u n . T h e
invocation to t h e M n e m o s y n e of Seals and Shadows at t h e begin-ning of t h e whole story seems to prove m y point. Whoever wishes
to know w h a t kind of rhetoric proceeded from t h e occult m e m o r y ,
let h i m read t h e Cena de le ceneri.
A n d this magical rhetoric has exerted an extraordinary influence.
M u c h of t h e legend of B r u n o , t h e martyr for m o d e r n science a n d
t h e Copernican theory, Bruno bursting out of mediaeval Aristote-lian trammels into t h e nineteenth century, rests on t h e rhetorical
passages in t h e Cena on t h e Copernican S u n and on t h e H e r m e t i c
ascent t h r o u g h t h e spheres.
T h e Cena de le ceneri affords an example of the development of a
literary work out of t h e procedures of t h e art of m e m o r y . F o r t h e
Cena is, of course, not a m e m o r y system; it is a set of dialogues
with lively and well characterised interlocutors, t h e philosopher,
t h e pedants, and others, a n d in which these people take p a r t in a
story, t h e journey to t h e S u p p e r a n d what h a p p e n e d w h e n they
arrived. T h e r e is satire in t h e w o r k ; and comic incidents. T h e r e is,

above all, d r a m a . Bruno wrote a comedy, the Candelaio or ' T o r c h
Bearer' w h e n in Paris, and he had distinct dramatic gifts which h e
felt stirring within h i m w h e n in England. W e can t h u s see in t h e
Cena h o w t h e art of m e m o r y could as it were develop into litera-t u r e ; h o w t h e streets of m e m o r y places could become populated
with characters, could become the backcloth for a drama. T h e
influence of t h e art of m e m o r y on literature is a practically un-touched subject. T h e Cena affords an example of a work of ima-ginative literature t h e connection of which with t h e art of m e m o r y
is u n d o u b t e d .
Another interesting feature is t h e use of allegory within a
m n e m o n i c setting. M a k i n g their way along t h e m e m o r y places
towards a mystical objective, t h e seekers meet with m a n y impedi-m e n t s . T h e y try to save t i m e b y taking an old creaking b o a t ; this
only brings t h e m back to w h e r e they started, and in a worse case,
struggling between high walls in a dark and miry lane. Back in t h e
Strand they persevere towards Charing Cross, b u t t e d and buffeted
b y insensitive crowds of animal-like people. A n d w h e n they do at
last arrive at t h e S u p p e r t h e r e is a lot of formality about where they
are to sit. A n d t h e pedants are there, arguing about t h e S u n , or is it
about t h e S u p p e r ? T h e r e is in the Cena something which r e m i n d s
one of t h e obscure struggles of t h e people in Kafka's world,
a n d t h a t is t h e kind of level o n which these dialogues should
b e read. A n d yet such m o d e r n parallels may b e misleading;
for in t h e Cena w e are in t h e Italian Renaissance where people
b u r s t easily into love lyrics from Ariosto; and t h e m e m o r y
places are places in Elizabethan L o n d o n , where dwell mysterious
knightly poets w h o seem h e r e to b e presiding over a very
mysterious gathering.
O n e reading of t h e allegory in t h e occult m e m o r y places m i g h t
b e that t h e old decaying N o a h ' s Ark of a boat was t h e C h u r c h
which landed t h e pilgrim between t h e walls of an unsatisfactory
convent, whence h e escaped feeling himself entrusted with a
heroic mission, only to find t h a t t h e Protestants, with their
Supper, were even m o r e blind to t h e rays of t h e returning S u n of
magical religion.

T h i s was t h e book which aroused t h e storms of protest which
obliged Bruno to stay within the embassy, u n d e r the ambassador's
protection. 1 1 A n d in t h e same year his disciple, Dicsono, was
having his tussle with t h e Ramist. W h a t sensations in t h e m e m o r y

Black Friars making places in L o n d o n on which to memorise t h e

heretical ex-Friar was using t h e ancient technique in his most
extraordinary version of t h e Renaissance occult transformation of
t h e art of m e m o r y .
T h e Cena ends with curious mythological adjurations addressed
to those who have criticised it. ' I address all of you together, calling
u p o n some in t h e n a m e of Minerva's shield and spear, u p o n others
in t h a t of t h e noble issue of t h e T r o j a n horse, u p o n others b y t h e
venerable beard of Aesculapius, u p o n others by N e p t u n e ' s trident,
u p o n others b y the kicks which t h e horses gave to Glaucus, a n d
asking all so to conduct yourselves in future that we m a y be able to
write better dialogues about you, or hold our peace.' 1 3 T h o s e w h o

a religion of natural contemplation. T h e pattern of the work is
formed b y a succession of about fifty emblems which are described
in poems a n d discussed in commentaries on t h e poems. T h e images
are mostly Petrarchan conceits about eyes and stars, arrows of
C u p i d , 1 4 a n d so on, or impresa shields with devices on t h e m . T h e s e
images are strongly charged with emotion. Read in t h e context of

the m a n y passages in t h e m e m o r y works on t h e need for magic
m e m o r y images to b e charged with affects, a n d particularly with
the affect of love, we begin to see the love emblems of t h e Eroici
furori in a n e w context, not, of course, as a m e m o r y system, b u t as
traces of t h e m e m o r y m e t h o d s in a literary work. Particularly w h e n
t h e series leads u p towards the end to a vision of Circe t h e enchan-tress do w e begin to feel ourselves within t h e familiar patterns of
Bruno's m i n d .
A question m a y b e asked here. D i d t h e persistent tradition which
associated Petrarch with m e m o r y include some view of t h e conceits
as m e m o r y images ? S u c h images after all contain t h e 'intentions'
of t h e soul towards an object. At any rate, B r u n o is using t h e con-ceits with strong intentions, as imaginative and magical means of
achieving insight. A connection with Seals of this litany of love
images is suggested b y a reference to t h e 'contractions' or religious
experiences described in t h e Seal of Seals. 1 5
T h i s book shows t h e Philosopher as Poet, p o u r i n g out t h e
images of his m e m o r y in poetic form. T h e recurring poems on
Actaeon, w h o h u n t s after t h e vestiges of the divine in n a t u r e until
h e is himself h u n t e d a n d devoured by his dogs, express a mystical
identification of subject with object, a n d t h e wildness of t h e chase,
amidst t h e woods a n d waters of contemplation, after t h e divine
object. H e r e , too, there appears a vast vision of A m p h i t r i t e ,
embodying like some great m e m o r y statue, t h e enthusiast's
imaginative grasp of the monas or the One.
T h e plan of Bruno's Spaccio delta bestia trionfante, published in
England in 1585 and dedicated to Sidney, is based on t h e images
of t h e forty-eight constellations of t h e sky, t h e n o r t h e r n constel-lations, t h e zodiac, and t h e southern constellations. I have else-w h e r e suggested that B r u n o may have been using t h e Fabularum
liber of H y g i n u s , with its account of the forty-eight constellation
images a n d t h e mythology associated with t h e m . 1 6 B r u n o uses t h e
order of t h e constellations as t h e g r o u n d plan of his sermon o n
virtues a n d vices. T h e 'Expulsion of t h e T r i u m p h a n t Beast' is t h e
expulsion of vice b y virtue, a n d in his long sermon on this text
B r u n o describes in detail h o w to each of t h e forty-eight constel15

lations virtues are triumphantly m o u n t i n g whilst opposite vices
descend, vanquished b y virtues in t h e great reform of t h e heavens.
Johannes R o m b e r c h , t h e Dominican author of the m e m o r y
text-book of which we have found so m u c h evidence that it was very
well k n o w n to B r u n o , mentions that the Fabularum liber of Hyginus
provides an easily memorised order of m e m o r y 1 7 places. I t gives
you, thinks R o m b e r c h , a fixed order which can be usefully used as
a m e m o r y order.
Virtues a n d vices, rewards and punishments—were not these t h e
basic themes of t h e sermons of the old friars ? R o m b e r c h ' s advice
about using H y g i n u s o n t h e order of t h e constellations as a m e m o r y
order, if adopted b y a preaching friar, m i g h t have been used for
memorising a sermon on virtues and vices. W h e n B r u n o in t h e
dedication of t h e Spaccio to Sidney lists t h e ethical themes which
h e is attaching to t h e forty eight constellations 1 8 might not this
have b r o u g h t to m i n d a type of preaching very different from that
n o w current in Elizabethan England ? A n d such an evocation of
t h e past would b e underlined by t h e constant attacks in t h e Spaccio
on t h e m o d e r n pedants w h o despise good works, an obvious allu-sion to t h e Calvanist emphasis on justification b y faith. W h e n Jove
calls o n some future Herculean deliverer to rid E u r o p e of t h e
miseries which afflict it, M o m u s a d d s :
It will be sufficient if that hero puts an end to that idle sect of
pedants, who, without doing good according to divine and natural
law, consider themselves and want to be considered religious men
pleasing to the gods, and say that to do good is good, and to do
ill is wicked. But they say it is not by the good that is done, or
by the evil that is not done, that one becomes worthy and pleasing
to the gods, but rather it is by hoping and believing according to
their catechism. Behold, oh gods, if there ever existed ribaldry more
open than this . . . T h e worst is that they defame us, saying that this
(religion of theirs) is an institution of the gods; and it is with this
that they criticise effects and fruits, even referring to them with the
title of defects and vices. Whereas nobody works for them and they
work for nobody (because their only labour is to speak ill of
works), they, at the same time, live on the works of those who have

laboured for others rather than for them, and who for others have
instituted temples, chapels, lodgings, hospitals, schools, and

the hereditary wealth of others who, if they are not perfect nor as
good as they should be, will not be, however (as are the first), per-verse and pernicious to the world, but rather will be necessary to the
republic, will be experts in the speculative sciences, students of
morality, solicitous of augmenting zeal and concern for helping one
another and of upholding society (for which all laws are ordained)
by proposing certain rewards to benefactors and threatening
certain punishments to delinquents. 19
T h i s was t h e kind of thing that could n o t b e said openly i n
Elizabethan England, save b y someone safe i n t h e F r e n c h embassy

virtues a n d vices, memorised o n t h e constellations, it m u s t have
been pretty clear t h a t t h e ex-friar's sermon h a d a n application t o
t h e teachings of t h e Calvanist ' p e d a n t s ' a n d t o t h e destruction
which they h a d w r o u g h t u p o n t h e works of others. B r u n o prefers
to such doctrines t h e moral laws which t h e ancients taught. As a

course know t h e u s e m a d e of ' T u l l i u s ' a n d other ancient writers
o n ethics i n t h e T h o m i s t definitions of t h e virtues and vices.
Nevertheless, t h e Spaccio is very far from being t h e sermon of a

m e m o r y systems. T h e i r reform, t h o u g h based o n moral laws,
virtues a n d vices as they conceive t h e m , includes t h e r e t u r n of
' E g y p t i a n ' magical religion of which there is a long defence, 2 1 w i t h
a long quotation from t h e Asclepius on how t h e Egyptians knew h o w
to make statues of t h e gods into which they drew d o w n celestial
powers. T h e L a m e n t in t h e Asclepius for t h e suppression of t h e
divine Egyptian magical religion is also quoted in full. B r u n o ' s
moral reform is t h u s 'Egyptian' or H e r m e t i c in quality a n d t h e
association of this side of it with t h e old virtue and vice preaching
results, in a m o s t curious way, in a new ethic—an ethic of natural
religion a n d a natural morality t h r o u g h t h e following of natural
laws. T h e virtue a n d vice system is related to t h e good and b a d
sides of planetary influences, and t h e reform is to make t h e good
sides t r i u m p h over t h e bad a n d to emphasise t h e influence of good
planets. H e n c e there is to result a personality in which Apollonian
religious insight combines with Jovial respect for moral l a w ; t h e
natural instincts of Venus are refined into a complexion ' m o r e
gentle, m o r e cultivated, m o r e ingenious, m o r e perspicacious, m o r e
u n d e r s t a n d i n g ' ; 2 2 a n d a general benevolence and philanthropy is
to replace t h e cruelties of t h e warring sects.
T h e Spaccio is an independent work of imaginative literature.
Its dialogues m a y b e read straightforwardly for their bold and
strange t r e a t m e n t of m a n y themes, for their curious h u m o u r a n d
satire, for t h e dramatic treatment of t h e story of this reforming
council of t h e gods, for their m a n y touches of Lucianic irony.
Nevertheless t h e structure of a Brunian m e m o r y system can b e
clearly perceived underlying t h e work. I n his usual way h e has
taken a system from t h e m e m o r y text-books, t h e use of Hyginus on
t h e order of t h e constellations as a m e m o r y order, a n d has 'occultised' it into a 'Seal' of his own. His intense concern with t h e actual
images of t h e constellations can b e clearly seen to belong into his
magical modes of thinking as w e have found t h e m in his books o n
memory.
I t is therefore, I think, justifiable to say that t h e Spaccio
represents t h e type of celestial rhetoric which goes with a Brunian
occult m e m o r y system. T h e speeches, listing t h e epithets describ-ing the good sides of t h e influences of t h e planetary gods, w o u l d b e

I n t h e heated atmosphere surrounding Bruno's controversy with

dedication of such a work as this to Sidney. T h e 'Egyptian'
lengths to which 'Scepsians' like N o l a n o a n d Dicsono m i g h t go
were indeed m a d e evident in t h e Spaccio. Yet to some this strange
work might have come as a blinding revelation of an i m m i n e n t
universal H e r m e t i c religious a n d moral reform, presented in t h e
splendid imagery of some great Renaissance work of art, painted
a n d sculptured within b y t h e m e m o r y artist.
T h e Italian dialogues with their underlying m e m o r y Seals would
refer t h e reader back to Seals as t h e operative Brunian work, the
one which opened his whole campaign in England a n d m a d e t h e
art of m e m o r y a crucial issue. T h e reader of Seals w h o h a d pene-trated to the Seal of Seals might hear t h e Italian dialogues poetically,
see t h e m artistically, and u n d e r s t a n d t h e m philosophically, as
sermons on t h e religion of Love, Art, Magic, and Mathesis.
S u c h were t h e influences emanating from t h e strange occupant
of t h e F r e n c h embassy during t h e years 1583 to 1586. T h e s e were
t h e crucial years, t h e germinal years, for t h e inception of the Eng-lish poetic Renaissance, ushered in b y Philip Sidney and his g r o u p
of friends. I t was to this circle t h a t B r u n o addressed himself,
dedicating to Sidney t h e two most significant dialogues, t h e Eroici
jurori and t h e Spaccio. I n words strangely prophetic of his future
fate, h e speaks of himself in t h e Spaccio dedications:
We see how this man, as a citizen and servant of the world, a child
of Father Sun and Mother Earth, because he loves the world too
much, must be hated, censured, persecuted and extinguished by it.
But, in the meantime, may he not be idle or badly employed while
awaiting his death, his transmigration, his change. Let him today
present to Sidney the numbered and arranged seeds of his moral
philosophy . . . 2 3

( N u m b e r e d a n d arranged indeed they are, as in a celestial m e m o r y
system.) N o r do w e now have to rely only on t h e dedications for
evidence of t h e significance of Bruno in Sidney's circle; we have
seen h o w t h e issues associated with t h e 'Scepsians', Nolano and
Dicsono, in their controversies with Aristotelians a n d Ramists
seem to hover around Sidney. Sidney's inseparable friend, Fulke
Greville, figures as host at t h e mysterious Supper, and is mentioned
in t h e Spaccio dedication as 'that second m a n w h o , after your
(i.e. Sidney's) first good offices, extended a n d offered to m e t h e
second'. 2 4 Surely Bruno's impact on England m u s t have been t h e
s u p r e m e experience of these years, a sensation closely associated
with the leaders of t h e English Renaissance.
A n d what of t h e influence of this impact on h i m w h o was to b e
t h e s u p r e m e manifestation of this very late Renaissance ? Shakes-peare was nineteen w h e n B r u n o came to England a n d twenty-two
when h e left it. W e do not know in what year Shakespeare came to
L o n d o n a n d began his career as actor and playwright; we only
know that it m u s t have been some time before 1592 when h e was
already well established. Amongst the scraps of evidence or
r u m o u r a b o u t Shakespeare there is one which connects h i m with
Fulke Greville. I n a book published in 1665 it is said of Greville
that
One great argument for his worth, was his respect for the worth
of others, desiring to be known to posterity under no other notions
than of Shakespeare's and Ben Johnson's Master, Chancellor
Egerton's Patron, Bishop Overall's Lord, and Sir Philip Sidney's
friend. 25
I t is not k n o w n w h e n , or in w h a t way, Greville may have b e e n
Shakespeare's master. But it is likely that Shakespeare m a y have
k n o w n Greville for t h e y b o t h came from Warwickshire; 2 6 G r e ville's family seat was near Stratford-on-Avon. W h e n t h e y o u n g
m a n from Stratford came to L o n d o n it is therefore possible t h a t
h e might have h a d access to Greville's house and circle, w h e r e h e
might have learned to know w h a t it m e a n t to use t h e zodiac in
artificial m e m o r y , like M e t r o d o r u s of Scepsis.

T H E THEATRE MEMORY SYSTEM
OF ROBERT F L U D D

DURING

t h e period of t h e English Renaissance, t h e
H e r m e t i c influences were at their height in E u r o p e ,
but
full-scale treatment of H e r m e t i c philosophy by
an Englishman was published until t h e reign of James I.
R o b e r t F l u d d 1 is one of t h e best-known of H e r m e t i c philosophers,
a n d his n u m e r o u s a n d abstruse works, m a n y of t h e m beautifully
illustrated with hieroglyphic engravings, have been attracting a
good deal of attention in recent years. F l u d d was in t h e full
Renaissance H e r m e t i c Cabalist tradition as it h a d descended from
Ficino a n d Pico della Mirandola. H e was saturated in t h e Corpus
Hermeticum, which h e read in Ficino's translation, a n d in t h e
Asclepius, a n d it is hardly an exaggeration to say that quotations
from t h e works of ' H e r m e s Trismegistus' are to b e found on
nearly every page of his works. H e was also a Cabalist, in descent
from Pico della Mirandola a n d Reuchlin, a n d so closely does F l u d d
seem to represent t h e Renaissance occult tradition that I have
elsewhere used some of t h e engraved illustrations in his works,
with their diagrammatic presentations of his outlook, to clarify t h e
earlier Renaissance synthesis. 2
But F l u d d lived in times w h e n the Renaissance modes of

generation of seventeenth-century philosophers. T h e authority of
t h e Hermetica was weakened when Isaac Casaubon, in 1614, dated
t h e m as having been written in post-Christian times. 3 F l u d d
totally ignored this dating and continued to regard t h e Hermetica
as the actual writings of the most ancient Egyptian sage. His pas-sionate defence of his beliefs and outlook b r o u g h t h i m into active
conflict with t h e leaders of the new age. His controversies with
M e r s e n n e a n d with Kepler are famous, and in these controversies
h e appears in t h e character of a 'Rosicrucian'. W h e t h e r or not t h e
Rosicrucians actually existed, it is a fact that the manifestos
announcing t h e existence of a brotherhood of t h e Rosy Cross
aroused i m m e n s e excitement and interest in t h e early years of t h e
seventeenth century. I n his earliest works, F l u d d announced
himself a disciple of t h e Rosicrucians and became identified by t h e
general public with t h e mysterious and invisible brotherhood and
its elusive aims.
W e have always found that t h e H e r m e t i c or occult philosopher
is likely to b e interested in t h e art of memory, and F l u d d is n o
exception to this rule. C o m i n g as h e does so very late in the Renais-sance, at a time w h e n the Renaissance philosophies are about to give
way before t h e rising movements of t h e seventeenth century,
F l u d d erects what is probably t h e last great m o n u m e n t of Renais-sance m e m o r y . A n d , like its first great m o n u m e n t , F l u d d ' s
m e m o r y system takes a theatre as its architectural form. Camillo's
T h e a t r e opened our series of Renaissance m e m o r y systems;
F l u d d ' s T h e a t r e will close it.
Since, as will b e suggested in t h e next chapter, F l u d d ' s m e m o r y
system m a y have a rather breath-taking importance as a reflection
—distorted by t h e mirrors of magic m e m o r y — o f Shakespeare's
Globe T h e a t r e , I h o p e that t h e reader will bear with m y pains-taking efforts in this chapter to break t h e last of the Seals of
M e m o r y with which I shall confront h i m .
T h e m e m o r y system is to b e found in t h e work which is F l u d d ' s
most characteristic and complete presentation of his philosophy.
It has t h e c u m b r o u s title Utriusque Cosmi, Maioris scilicet et
Minoris, metaphysica, physica, atque technica Historia. T h e 'greater
and lesser worlds' which this history claims to cover are t h e great

extremely mystical dedications, t h e first to G o d , t h e second to
James I as G o d ' s representative on earth. T h e second volume, on
t h e microcosm, came out in 1619 with a dedication to G o d in

From this setting-out of the complex publication of the work, it can be
seen that Tomus Primus, on the macrocosm, was published in two parts in
1617 and 1618; Tomus Secundus, on the microcosm, was published in
1619 (the Frankfort publication of 1621 was a later part of this volume).
John Theodore de Bry, the publisher of the whole series, was the son
of Theodore de Bry (who died in 1598) whose publishing and engraving
business he inherited. John Theodore de Bry is stated on the title-pages of
Tomus Primus to be responsible for the engravings ('aere Johan-Theodori
de Bry'), but this is not stated on the title-pages of Tomus Secundus. The
engraved title-page of De Naturae Simia (1618) is signed 'M. Merian
sculp.'. Matthieu Merian was John Theodore de Bry's son-in-law and a
member of the firm.

dedication of t h e first volume h e was very closely associated with
the Deity, presumably his presence is still implied in t h e dedica-tion of t h e second volume to t h e Deity alone. I t is almost as t h o u g h
F l u d d calls o n James in these dedications as Defender of t h e
H e r m e t i c Faith.
At a b o u t this t i m e w e know that F l u d d was appealing very
specially to James to support h i m against t h e attacks of his enemies.
A manuscript in t h e British M u s e u m , of probably about 1618,
contains a 'Declaration' b y R o b e r t F l u d d about his printed works
and his views addressed to James. 5 H e defends b o t h himself a n d
t h e Rosicrucians as harmless followers of divine a n d ancient
philosophies, mentions t h e dedication of t h e Macrocosm
to
James, a n d appends testimonials from foreign scholars about
t h e value of his writings. T h e dedication to James of t h e work,
the second volume of which contains t h e m e m o r y system, t h u s
belongs to a period of his life w h e n h e felt himself to b e u n d e r
attack and wished very particularly to enlist the support of t h e
King.
F l u d d was living in England at the time w h e n h e wrote this a n d
other works, yet h e did n o t publish this or his other works in
England. T h i s fact was noted as detrimental b y one of his enemies.
I n 1631, a certain D r . William Foster, an Anglican parson,
attacked F l u d d ' s Paracelsan medicine as magical, alluded to t h e
fact t h a t M a r i n M e r s e n n e had called h i m a magician, and in-sinuated t h a t it was because of his reputation as a magician that h e
did not p u b l i s h his works in England. ' I suppose this to b e one
cause w h y h e h a t h printed his bookes beyond t h e Seas. O u r
Universities a n d our Reverend Bishops ( G o d bee thanked) are
m o r e cautelous t h a n to allow t h e Printing of Magical books
h e r e . ' 6 I n his reply to Foster (with w h o m h e said that h e did not
differ in religion) F l u d d took u p t h e references to his controversy
with M e r s e n n e . ' M e r s e n n e has accused m e of magic, a n d Foster

k i n g d o m . ' 7 F l u d d says that h e was able to convince K i n g James of
the innocency of his works and intentions (alluding probably to
t h e 'Declaration') and points to the fact that h e dedicated a book
to James (alluding certainly to the dedication of the Utriusque
Cosmi . . . Historia) as evidence that there was nothing wrong
with t h e m . A n d h e firmly rejected Foster's explanation of why
h e sent his works beyond the seas to be printed. ' I sent t h e m beyond
the Seas because our home-borne Printers d e m a n d e d five h u n d r e d
p o u n d s to p r i n t t h e first volume and to find the cuts in c o p p e r ; b u t
beyond t h e Seas it was printed at no cost of m i n e , and that as I
would wish . . ,' 8 T h o u g h F l u d d published a good m a n y books
with engraved illustrations beyond the seas, this remark almost
certainly refers particularly to t h e Utriusque Cosmi . . . Historia,
b o t h volumes of which are illustrated with a remarkable series of
engravings.
T h e illustrations of his works was very important to F l u d d for
it was part of his p u r p o s e to present his philosophy visually or in
'hieroglyphics'. T h i s aspect of F l u d d ' s philosophy came out in his
controversy with Kepler, w h e n t h e mathematician taunted h i m
with his 'pictures' and 'hieroglyphs', with his use of n u m b e r 'after
t h e H e r m e t i c fashion', as compared with t h e genuinely mathe-matical diagrams in Kepler's own works. 9 F l u d d ' s pictures and
hieroglyphics are often extremely complicated and it would matter
very m u c h to h i m that they should correspond accurately with his
complicated text. H o w did F l u d d communicate to the publisher
and engraver in G e r m a n y his wishes about t h e illustrations ?
If F l u d d needed a trusty emissary to carry his text and materials
for the illustrations to O p p e n h e i m , there was one at h a n d in
Michael Maier. T h i s m a n , w h o h a d belonged to t h e circle of the
E m p e r o r R u d o l p h I I , certainly believed in t h e existence of Rosicrucians and believed that h e was himself one of t h e m . I t is said

Hermetic-Cabalist tradition; that it taps t h e tradition at t h e t i m e
of t h e 'Rosicrucian' furore; that its dedication attempts to enlist
James I as defender of t h e tradition; that liaison between F l u d d in
E n g l a n d a n d t h e publisher in G e r m a n y could have b e e n effected
t h r o u g h Michael Maier or t h r o u g h channels of communication
between t h e D e Bry firm and England established during t h e
earlier publishing enterprises.
I n view of this significant historical situation of t h e book, it is
significant to find t h a t it contains an occult m e m o r y system, a
m e m o r y 'Seal', t h e complexity and mystery of which are worthy of
B r u n o himself.

Maier's Atalanta fugiens, with its remarkable illustrations, was
published by John Theodore de Bry at Oppenheim in 1617; his

It should be added that channels of business communication between
the De Bry firm and England may well have been established by the elder
De Bry (Theodore de Bry) who published in America engravings after the
drawings of John White. Theodore de Bry visited England in 1587 to
collect materials and illustrations for his publications of voyages of
discovery. See P. Hulton and D. B. Quinn, The American Drawings of

F l u d d treats of the art of m e m o r y in the second volume of his
History of the Two Worlds, t h e one on m a n as microcosm, where he
gives what h e calls ' t h e technical history of t h e microcosm' by
which h e means t h e technich or arts used by the microcosm. T h e
contents of this part are usefully set out in visual form at the
beginning of it. H o m o , t h e microcosm, has above his head a
triangular glory marking his divine origin; below his feet is a
monkey, F l u d d ' s favourite symbol of the art by which m a n imi-tates, or reflects, nature. T h e segments of the circle show the arts
or technics about to b e treated, and which are in fact treated in this
order in the following chapters. T h e y are:—Prophecy, Geomancy,
Art of M e m o r y , Genethliology (the art of horoscope making),
Physiognomics, Chiromancy, Pyramids of Science. T h e art of
m e m o r y is designated by five m e m o r y loci with images on t h e m .
T h e context in w h i c h we see the art of memory here is instructive;
its places a n d images are next door to the horoscope diagram,
marked with t h e signs of the zodiac. Other magical a n d occult arts
are in t h e series which also includes prophecy, suggesting mystical
and religious connotations, and the pyramids which are F l u d d ' s
favourite symbol of u p and down movement, or interaction
between t h e divine or the spiritual and t h e terrestrial or the
corporeal.
T h e chapter on ' t h e science of spiritual memorising which is
vulgarly called Ars Memoriae'13
is introduced by a picture
illustrating this science (P1. 15). W e see a m a n with a large 'eye of
imagination' in t h e fore part of his h e a d ; and beside h i m five
m e m o r y loci containing m e m o r y images. Five is F l u d d ' s favourite
n u m b e r for a g r o u p of m e m o r y places, as will appear later, and the
diagram also illustrates his principle of having one main image in a
m e m o r y room. T h e m a i n image is an obelisk; the others are the
T o w e r of Babel, Tobias and the Angel, a ship, and t h e Last
J u d g m e n t with the d a m n e d entering the m o u t h of Hell—an
interesting relic in this very late Renaissance system of the
mediaeval virtue of r e m e m b e r i n g Hell by the artificial memory.
T h e s e five images are nowhere explained or referred to in the
following text. I do not know whether they are intended to be read
allegorically—the obelisk as an Egyptian symbol referring to the
'inner writing' of the art which will overcome the confusions of

Babel and conduct its user u n d e r angelic guidance to religious
safety. T h i s may b e over fanciful, a n d in t h e absence of any
explanation b y F l u d d it is better to leave t h e m unexplained.
After some of t h e usual definitions of artificial m e m o r y , F l u d d
devotes a chapter 1 4 to explaining t h e distinction which h e makes
between t w o different types of art, which h e calls respectively t h e
' r o u n d art (ars rotunda)', and t h e 'square art (ars quadrata).'
For the complete perfection of the art of memory the fantasy is
operated in two ways. The first way is through ideas, which are
forms separated from corporeal things, such as spirits, shadows
(umbrae), souls and so on, also angels, which we chiefly use in our
ars rotunda. We do not use this word 'ideas' in the same way that
Plato does, who is accustomed to use it of the mind of God, but for
anything which is not composed of the four elements, that is to say
for things spiritual and simple conceived in the imagination; for
example angels, demons, the effigies of stars, the images of gods and
goddesses to whom celestial powers are attributed and which par-take more of a spiritual than of a corporeal nature; similarly virtues
and vices conceived in the imagination and made into shadows,
which were also to be held as demons. 15
T h e ' r o u n d a r t ' , t h e n , uses magicised or talismanic images,
effigies of t h e s t a r s ; 'statues' of gods and goddesses animated with
celestial influences; images of virtues and vices, as in t h e old
mediaeval art, b u t n o w thought of as containing ' d e m o n i c ' or
magical power. F l u d d is working at a classification of images into
potent a n d less potent such as was Bruno's constant preoccupa-tion.
T h e ' s q u a r e a r t ' uses images of corporeal things, of m e n , of
animals, of inanimate objects. W h e n its images are of m e n or of
animals, these are active, engaged in actions of some kind. T h e
'square a r t ' sounds like t h e ordinary art of memory, using t h e
active images of Ad Herennium a n d perhaps 'square' because using
buildings or rooms as places. T h e s e two arts, t h e r o u n d a n d t h e
square, are t h e only t w o possible arts of m e m o r y , states F l u d d .
Memory can only be artificially improved, either by medicaments,
or by the operation of the fantasy towards ideas in the round art,
or through images of corporeal things in the square art. 16

THE THEATRE MEMORY SYSTEM OF ROBERT FLUDD
T h e practice of t h e r o u n d art, t h o u g h it is quite different from the
art with t h e 'ring of Solomon' of which F l u d d heard r u m o u r s at
T o u l o u s e (and which m u s t have been blackly magical), demands
nevertheless, h e says, t h e assistance of demons (in t h e sense of
daemonic powers n o t of demons in Hell) or t h e metaphysical
influence of t h e H o l y Spirit. A n d it is necessary that ' t h e fantasy
should concur in t h e metaphysical act.' 1 7
M a n y people, continues F l u d d , prefer t h e square art because it
is easier, b u t t h e r o u n d art is infinitely t h e superior of t h e two.
F o r t h e r o u n d art is 'natural' using 'natural' places and is naturally
adapted to t h e microcosm. Whereas t h e square art is 'artificial'
using artificially m a d e u p places a n d images.
F l u d d t h e n devotes a whole, fairly long chapter, to a polemic
against t h e use of'fictitious places' in t h e square art. 1 8 T o under-stand this w e m u s t r e m i n d ourselves of t h e age long distinction,
stemming from Ad Herennium and t h e other classical sources
between 'real' a n d 'fictitious' memory places. 'Real' places are real
buildings of any kind used for forming places in t h e normal way in
t h e m n e m o t e c h n i c . 'Fictitious' places are imaginary buildings or
imaginary places of any kind which the author of Ad Herennium
said might b e invented if not enough real places were available.
T h e distinction between 'real' and 'fictitious' places went on for
ever in t h e m e m o r y treatises with m u c h elaborate glossing on these
themes. F l u d d is very m u c h against the use of'fictitious' buildings
in t h e square art. T h e s e confuse m e m o r y and a d d to its task. O n e
m u s t always use real places in real buildings. ' S o m e w h o are versed
in this art wish to place their square art in palaces fabricated or
erected b y invention of t h e imagination; that this opinion is
inconvenient w e will n o w briefly explain.' 1 9 So opens t h e chapter
17

Ibid., p. 51. T h e extremely magical art of memory of which Fludd
has heard at Toulouse sounds like the ars notoria. Fludd might possibly
be referring to Jean Belot who had been publishing in France earlier in the
century works on chiromancy, physiognomy, and the art of memory (on
Belot, see Thorndikea, History of Magic and Experimental Science, VI,
pp. 360–3). Belot's highly magical artificial memory, in which he mentions
Lull, Agrippa, and Bruno, is reprinted in the edition of his Oeuvres,
Lyons, 1654, pp. 329 ff. The art of memory by R. Saunders (Physiognomie
and Chiromancie . . . whereunto is added the Art of Memory, London, 1653,
1671) is based on that of Belot and repeats his mention of Bruno. Saunders
dedicated his book to Elias Ashmole.

against t h e use of fictitious places in the square art. It is an impor-tant chapter for, if t r u e to these strongly held views against ficti-tious places, t h e buildings which F l u d d will use in his m e m o r y
system will b e 'real' buildings.
H a v i n g laid d o w n his distinction between t h e ars rotunda and t h e
ars quadrata a n d t h e different kinds of images to b e used in each,
and having m a d e clear his view that t h e ars quadrata m u s t
always use real buildings, F l u d d now arrives at t h e exposition of
his m e m o r y system. 2 0 T h i s is a combination of t h e r o u n d a n d t h e
square. Based on t h e r o u n d heavens, the zodiac and t h e spheres of
t h e planets, it uses in combination with these, buildings which are
to b e placed in t h e heavens, buildings containing places with
m e m o r y images on t h e m which will be, as it were, astrally activated
by being organically related to the stars. W e have m e t this kind of
thing before. I n fact t h e idea is exactly the same as that in Bruno's
Images,21 w h e r e h e used sets of atria or rooms, cubicles, a n d
'fields', c r a m m e d with images, and activated by being organically
affiliated to his ' r o u n d ' art, the images in which were gods a n d
goddesses to w h o m celestial influences were attributed. Bruno h a d
also laid d o w n t h e distinction between what F l u d d calls t h e
' r o u n d ' a n d t h e 'square' arts in his Seals published in England
thirty-six years before F l u d d ' s work. 2 2
T h e striking a n d exciting feature of F l u d d ' s m e m o r y system is
that the m e m o r y buildings which are to b e placed in t h e heavens
in this n e w combination of the r o u n d and t h e square arts, are w h a t
h e calls 'theatres'. A n d by this w o r d 'theatre' h e does n o t m e a n
what we should call a theatre, a building consisting of a stage a n d
an auditorium. H e means a stage. T h e t r u t h of this statement t h a t
t h e 'theatre' which F l u d d illustrates is really a stage, will b e amply
proved later. I t will, however, b e useful to state it here in advance
before starting on t h e m e m o r y system.
T h e ' c o m m o n place' of t h e ars rotunda, states F l u d d , is ' t h e
ethereal part of the world, t h a t is t h e celestial orbs n u m b e r e d from
t h e eighth sphere a n d ending in t h e sphere of the m o o n . ' 2 3 T h i s
statement is illustrated b y a diagram (P1. 16) showing t h e eighth
sphere, or zodiac, m a r k e d with the signs of the zodiac, and

enclosing seven circles representing the spheres of the planets, and
a circle representing t h e sphere of t h e elements at the centre. T h i s
represents, say F l u d d , a 'natural' order of m e m o r y places based
on t h e zodiac, a n d also a temporal order t h r o u g h the m o v e m e n t of
t h e spheres in relation to t i m e . 2 4
O n either side of t h e sign Aries, two small buildings are shown.
T h e y are tiny 'theatres', or stages. T h e s e two 'theatres', in this
actual form with two doors at t h e back of t h e stage, are never
illustrated again nor referred to in the text. A n occult m e m o r y
system always has m a n y unexplained lacunae a n d I do n o t under-stand w h y F l u d d never afterwards mentions these two 'theatres'. I
can only suppose that they are placed here on t h e cosmic diagram
as a kind of advance statement of the principle of this m e m o r y
system, which will use 'theatres', buildings containing m e m o r y
loci after t h e m a n n e r of t h e ars quadrata, b u t placed o n t h e great
c o m m o n place of t h e ars rotunda, that is placed in t h e zodiac.
Exactly facing the diagram of the heavens, on the next page of
t h e book, there is an engraving of a 'theatre' (P1. 17). T h e diagram
of t h e heavens and t h e picture of the 'theatre' are placed on oppo-site pages in such a m a n n e r that, w h e n t h e book is closed, t h e
heavens cover t h e theatre. T h i s theatre, as already stated, is not a
complete theatre b u t a stage. T h e wall facing u s , as we gaze at it,
is its frons scaenae, containing five entrances, as in the classical
frons scaenae. T h i s is, however, not a classical stage. I t is an
Elizabethan or Jacobean multilevel stage. T h r e e of t h e entrances
are on g r o u n d level; two are arches, b u t t h e central one can be
closed b y heavy hinged doors which are shown half open. T h e
other two entrances are on an u p p e r level; they open on to a
battlemented terrace. I n the centre, as a very noticeable feature of
this stage, there is a kind of bay window, or an u p p e r chamber or
room.
T h i s picture of a 'theatre' or stage is introduced by F l u d d with
t h e following w o r d s :
24
If this, the basic diagram for the ars rotunda, is compared with the
design on the title-page of the first volume of the Utriusque Cosmi . . .
Historia, we see there the temporal revolution visually depicted through
the rope wound round macrocosm and microcosm which Time is
pulling. We can also understand by comparison with this picture, in which
the microcosm is represented within the macrocosm, why the 'round' art
of memory is the 'natural' one for the microcosm.
330

THE THEATRE MEMORY SYSTEM OF ROBERT FLUDD
I call a theatre (a place in which) all actions of words, of sentences,
of particulars of a speech or of subjects are shown, as in a public
theatre in which comedies and tragedies are acted.25
F l u d d is going to use this theatre as a m e m o r y place system for
m e m o r y for words and m e m o r y for things. But t h e theatre itself is
like 'a public theatre in which comedies and tragedies are acted.'
T h o s e great wooden theatres in which the works of Shakespeare
and others were played were technically known as 'public theatres'.
I n view of F l u d d ' s strong convictions about t h e undesirability of
using 'fictitious places' in m e m o r y , can we assume that this is a
real stage in a public theatre which h e is showing us ?
T h e chapter containing t h e illustration of the theatre is headed
' T h e description of t h e eastern and western theatres' a n d it
appears t h a t there are to be two of these theatres, the one 'eastern'
and t h e other 'western', identical in plan b u t different in colour.
T h e eastern theatre is to b e light, bright and shining, since it will
hold actions belonging to t h e day. T h e western theatre will b e
dark, black and obscure, belonging to the night. Both are to b e
placed in t h e heavens, a n d refer, presumably, to t h e day and night
' h o u s e s ' of t h e planets. Is there to b e an eastern and a western
theatre for each of t h e signs of t h e zodiac ? Are they to b e placed as
we see those two little stages on each side of Aries on the plan, b u t
not only with one sign b u t all r o u n d t h e heavens ? I rather think
so. But we are in t h e realms of occult m e m o r y and it is not easy to
follow h o w these theatres in t h e heavens are supposed to work.
T h e closest comparison for this system is Bruno's system in
Images in which elaborate arrangements of m e m o r y rooms con-taining places for m e m o r y images (as in what F l u d d calls t h e
'square' art) are affiliated to a ' r o u n d ' or celestial system. Similarly
(or so I believe) F l u d d ' s 'theatres' are m e m o r y rooms which are to
be affiliated to t h e r o u n d heavens by being placed in t h e zodiac. If
h e intends that two such 'theatres' are to b e placed with each sign,
t h e n the 'theatre' which h e illustrates would b e one of twenty-four
identical m e m o r y rooms. T h e 'eastern' and 'western' or day a n d
night theatres introduce time into a system which is attached to
the revolution of t h e heavens. I t is of course a highly occult or
magical system, based on belief in t h e macrocosm-microcosm
relationship.

THE THEATRE MEMORY SYSTEM OF ROBERT FLUDD
O n the bay window of t h e 'theatre' are inscribed the words
THEATRUM ORBI. Since F l u d d and the highly educated engraver
certainly knew L a t i n it seems difficult to believe that this can b e a
mistake for THEATRUM ORBIS. I suggest therefore (though with
diffidence) t h a t t h e dative case is intentional and that t h e inscrip-tion m e a n s , not that this is a ' T h e a t r e of the W o r l d ' b u t one of t h e
'theatres' or stages to b e placed with or in the world, that is in t h e
heavens shown on the opposite page.
'Each of t h e theatres will have five doors distinct from one
another a n d a b o u t equidistant, t h e use of which we will explain
later' 2 6 says F l u d d . T h u s t h e five doors or entrances seen in t h e
picture of t h e 'theatre' are confirmed by the text which states that
t h e theatres have five doors. T h e r e is agreement between picture
a n d text about this. T h e use of the five doors in the theatres which
F l u d d explains later is t h a t they are to serve as five m e m o r y loci,
which stand in a relationship with five columns to which they are
said to b e opposite. 2 7 T h e bases of these five columns are shown in
t h e foreground of t h e picture of t h e 'theatre'. O n e is r o u n d , t h e
next square, t h e central one is hexagonal, and t h e n come another
square one a n d another r o u n d one. ' T h e r e are to b e feigned five
columns, distinguished from one another by shape and colour.
T h e shapes of t h e two at each extremity are circular and r o u n d ; the
middle column will have t h e figure of a hexagon; and the inter-mediary ones will b e s q u a r e . ' 2 8 H e r e again t h e picture corresponds
with t h e text, for t h e picture shows t h e bases of columns of these
shapes a n d arranged in this order.
T h e s e columns, continues F l u d d , are of different colours,
corresponding to ' t h e colours of t h e doors of t h e theatres opposite
to t h e m ' . T h e s e doors are to b e used as five m e m o r y loci and are to
b e distinguished from o n e another b y being r e m e m b e r e d as
different in colour. T h e first door will b e white, t h e second red, t h e
third green, the fourth blue, t h e fifth black. 2 9 T h e correspondence

debent figura & colore distingui; Figura enim duarum extremarum erit
circularis & rotunda, mediae autem columna habebit figuram hexagoneam, & quae his intermedia sunt quadratam possidebunt figuram'
(Ibid, p. 63). Though he speaks of 'fields' (prata) here, he is thinking of the
five doors as memory fields or places.

THE THEATRE MEMORY SYSTEM OF ROBERT FLUDD
between the doors and the columns is perhaps indicated in t h e
picture of t h e 'theatre' by t h e geometrical forms shown on t h e
battlemented terrace. I do not understand h o w these corresponden-cies are supposed to work in detail, t h o u g h it is clear that t h e m a i n
central door on g r o u n d level would correspond to t h e main central
column in t h e shape of a hexagon, and the other four doors to t h e
four circular and square columns.
W i t h this set of ten places, five doors and five columns, in all
t h e 'theatres', F l u d d is proposing to r e m e m b e r things and words in
his magical m e m o r y system. T h o u g h h e does not mention t h e
rules of Ad Herennium in connection with the doors and t h e
columns h e certainly has these in m i n d . T h e doors are spaced to
form suitable m e m o r y places. T h e columns are of different shapes
so that they m a y not b e too m u c h alike and confuse t h e m e m o r y .
T h e notion of r e m e m b e r i n g m e m o r y loci as of different colours
as an additional help for distinguishing between t h e m is not in Ad
Herennium b u t is often advised in the m e m o r y treatises.
T h e system works t h r o u g h being hitched to t h e stars, or rather
to the 'principle ideas' as F l u d d calls t h e m in a chapter on t h e
relation of t h e planets to t h e signs of the zodiac. 3 0 T h i s chapter
gives t h e celestial basis of t h e system; and it is immediately
followed by t h e chapter on the five doors and five columns in t h e
m e m o r y theatres. T h e heavens work together with t h e theatres,
and the theatres are in t h e heavens. T h e ' r o u n d ' and t h e ' s q u a r e '
art are united to form a m e m o r y 'Seal', or an occult m e m o r y
system of extreme complexity. F l u d d never uses t h e w o r d 'Seal',
b u t his m e m o r y system is undoubtedly of a Brunian type.
T w o other 'theatres' (P1. 18a, b) are illustrated in F l u d d ' s text.
T h e s e are n o t multilevel stages like t h e main theatres b u t m o r e like
rooms with one wall left out so that the spectator looks into t h e m .
T h e y have a matching connection with the main theatres t h r o u g h
the battlements on their walls which are of a similar design to t h e
battlements on t h e terraces of t h e main theatres. T h e s e subsidiary
theatres are also to b e used as m e m o r y rooms. O n e has three doors
and t h e other five; in t h e one with five doors there is a similar
system of columns, indicated b y their bases, and working in
connection with t h e doors, as in t h e m a i n theatres. T h e s e sub-sidiary theatres connect with t h e m a i n theatres and t h r o u g h t h e m
with the heavens.

THE THEATRE MEMORY SYSTEM OF ROBERT FLUDD
W e have spoken of t h e 'places' in F l u d d ' s system; t h e m a i n
' c o m m o n place' is t h e heavens with which are connected t h e thea-tres as m e m o r y rooms. W h a t about t h e second aspect of m e m o r y ,
'images' ? W h a t does F l u d d have to say about these ?
F o r his basic or celestial images he used talismanic or magic
images such as B r u n o uses on t h e central wheel of Shadows. T h e
images of t h e signs of t h e zodiac a n d the characters of t h e planets
are shown on t h e plan of t h e heavens, b u t not images of decans,
planets, houses, a n d so on. W e can however gather that F l u d d was
thinking on t h e lines of such images w h e n in his chapter on ' t h e
order of t h e principle ideas t h r o u g h t h e spheres of t h e planets' he
analyses t h e progression of Saturn t h r o u g h t h e zodiac, giving
different images of S a t u r n in different signs, and says that t h e same
m a y b e done with other planets. 3 1 T h e s e would be t h e celestial or
magically operative images to b e used in t h e ' r o u n d ' part of t h e
system.
After this chapter on images of t h e 'principle ideas' comes one
on 'less principal images' which are to be p u t in t h e theatres, on
t h e doors a n d t h e columns. T h e s e are t h e images to be used in the
' s q u a r e ' part of t h e art. T h e y are to be formed in accordance with
t h e rules for striking images in Ad Herennium, from which F l u d d
quotes, b u t as it were magicised in this magical system. Amongst
the sets of five images to be used in t h e theatres are Jason holding
the golden fleece, M e d e a , Paris, D a p h n e , P h o e b u s . Another set is
M e d e a collecting magic herbs, to be p u t on t h e white d o o r ;
M e d e a killing h e r b r o t h e r on t h e red d o o r ; and M e d e a in other
aspects on t h e other three doors. 3 2 T h e r e is another set of five
M e d e a i m a g e s ; 3 3 also some Circe images. T h e magic of these
sorceresses m u s t have been very helpful to t h e system.
Like B r u n o , F l u d d is deeply involved in the complexities of the
old m e m o r y treatises which survive in t h e midst of t h e magic and
add to its obscurity. Lists of names or things in alphabetical order
of t h e type so dear to writers like R o m b e r c h and Rossellius are
given, b u t n o w m a d e mysterious t h r o u g h their involvement in an
occult art. Amongst such lists as given b y F l u d d are all t h e main
mythological figures, a n d also lists of virtues and vices—the latter
reminding us of mediaeval artificial m e m o r y in t h e midst of t h e
extraordinary farrago.

F l u d d indeed makes very clear his attachment to the old m e m o r y
treatise tradition b y including illustrated specimens of Visual
alphabets'. 3 4 T h e visual alphabet was a sort of sign m a n u a l of t h e
old m e m o r y treatises. Probably already a d u m b r a t e d b y Boncompagno in t h e thirteenth century, we have met it again and again in
Publicius, R o m b e r c h , Rossellius, and so on. 3 5 Bruno t h o u g h h e
never actually illustrates a visual alphabet, frequently refers to t h e m
or describes t h e m in w o r d s . 3 6 F l u d d ' s visual alphabets show that,
like B r u n o , h e would think of his extraordinary m e m o r y 'Seal' as
still in continuity with t h e old memory tradition.
T o s u m u p , F l u d d ' s m e m o r y system appears to m e to be very
like one of Bruno's systems. T h e r e is the same terrific effort towards
a detailed a t t e m p t to use t h e principles of the art of m e m o r y in
association with t h e heavens to form a total world-reflecting
system. Besides t h e general plan of the whole thing, m a n y smaller
points r e m i n d one of B r u n o . F l u d d uses t h e terms 'cubicles' a n d
'fields' of m e m o r y places, terms often used by Bruno. H e does not,
however, appear to b e using Lullism, 3 7 nor does h e h a r p o n
'thirty' like B r u n o . T h e Brunian system which appears to m e
closest to F l u d d ' s system is t h e one in Images where there is a
similar attempt to use a very complex series of m e m o r y rooms in
association with t h e heavens. F o r Bruno's atria as m e m o r y r o o m s ,
F l u d d substitutes his 'theatres' as m e m o r y rooms, as t h e archi-tectural or ' s q u a r e ' side of a system used in conjunction with t h e
' r o u n d ' heavens.
T h i s 'theatre' or stage with its five doors to b e used as five
m e m o r y places is t h e leading motif of the whole system. W e can
see it a d u m b r a t e d in the introductory illustration (P1. 15) of t h e
m a n seeing with the eye of imagination five m e m o r y places with
their five images.
F l u d d himself gives t h e impression that h e learned his art of
m e m o r y in France. I n his earlier years h e had travelled in several
European countries a n d h a d spent some time in t h e south of
34

He also gives sets of visual images for numbers, again an old tradi-tion. Examples of memory places with images for numbers on them are
given in the section 'De Arithmetica Memoriali' in the first volume of the
book (Utriusque Cosmi . . . Historia, I, 2, pp. 153 ff.).

France. I n a section on the art of geomancy in the Utriusque
Cosmi. . . Historia h e says that h e practised geomancy at Avignon
in t h e winter of 1601–2, afterwards leaving that city for Marseilles
where h e instructed t h e Duc de Guise and his brother 'in t h e
mathematical sciences'. 3 8 T o t h e same period of F l u d d ' s life in
t h e south of F r a n c e m u s t refer t h e account which h e gives at the
beginning of t h e section on the art of m e m o r y of how h e first
became interested in this art at N î m e s ; t h e n further perfected
himself in it at A v i g n o n ; and w h e n h e went to Marseilles to teach
the Duc de Guise and his brother ' t h e mathematical sciences', h e
also taught those noblemen the art of m e m o r y . 3 9
F l u d d m a y therefore have heard of Camillo's T h e a t r e and of
Bruno's works w h e n in France. But Seals h a d been published in
England, and Dicsono h a d taught t h e art of m e m o r y in L o n d o n
long after Bruno's departure. T h e r e could therefore have been a
tradition of Brunian m e m o r y descending in England and reaching
F l u d d t h a t way.
A n d one wonders whether an immediate influence on F l u d d ' s
m e m o r y system m a y have come from a work published in L o n d o n
in 1618, that is one year before t h e publication, in 1619, of the part
of t h e Utriusque Cosmi . . . Historia which contains the m e m o r y
system. T h i s was t h e Mnemonica; sive Ars reminiscendi b y J o h n

business which h e has to do in a market t o w n :
T h e first business he thinks upon, is to enquire the price of seed
wheat in the market. Let him therefore suppose in the first place
or roome of the first Repositorie, that he seeth diuers men standing
together with sacks of corne . . . and that on the nearer side of the
stage, he seeth a country man clad in russet, with a paire of high
shooes on, pouring wheate out of a sacke into a bushell, the eares or
handles whereof are of pure gold; that by this supposition the Idea
may haue the colour of the Repositorie, which is gold, attributed

T h e second business is to procure mowers to cut down medow

the blades whereof are of gold, agreeable to the colour of the Repositorie . . . T h e relation which this Idea hath unto the former, is in
respect of situation, because both Ideas are placed upon the stage
of the first Repositorie . . .41
T h i s seems a perfectly rational use of the art as a straight m n e m o t e c h n i c ; it m i g h t work very well as an inner shopping list, w h e n ,
as t h e author says 'we are destitute of t h e aid of Paper, Ink, or
T a b l e - B o o k s ' . 4 2 T h e similarity to F l u d d ' s use of sets o f ' t h e a t r e s '
with columns in t h e m as m e m o r y rooms is however striking; also
t h e emphasis on differentiating m e m o r y places by r e m e m b e r i n g
t h e m as of different colours. A n d t h e r e m i g h t even b e a h u m b l e
origin for F l u d d ' s marvellous D a y a n d N i g h t theatres in t h e
zodiac in WiUis's advice t h a t 'things charged in M e m o r y by day,
are to b e deposited at least before sleep; things charged by night
are to b e deposited immediately after sleep'. 4 3
It was B r u n o ' s custom to take a rational m e m o r y system a n d
'occultise' it into a magical system; we have seen h i m doing t h a t
again a n d again. Possibly this is what F l u d d did to WiUis's sets of
what h e calls 'theatres' as m e m o r y r o o m s ; h e occultised t h e m into
magical activity b y affiliating t h e m to t h e zodiac. Alternatively,
w h e n we r e m e m b e r how at about t h e same time in France, P a e p p
was 'detecting' Schenkel, 4 4 detecting in his apparently rational
expositions of t h e art of m e m o r y an occult u n d e r c u r r e n t , we m a y
w o n d e r w h e t h e r t h e r e was m o r e t h a n meets t h e eye in WiUis's
Mnemonica. I cannot solve this little problem b u t it h a d to b e
mentioned because t h e fact that an art of m e m o r y using sets of
'theatres', or stages, as m e m o r y rooms was pubUshed in England
t h e year before t h e publication of F l u d d ' s system is somewhat
significant, suggesting as it does t h a t it may not have been solely
t h r o u g h his travels abroad t h a t F l u d d h a d heard of the art of
memory.
At any rate, F l u d d ' s m e m o r y system seems to take us back m a n y
years to t h e time of t h e great controversies centred on M e t r o dorus of Scepsis and t h e use of t h e zodiac in artificial m e m o r y , with
all that that implied. H a d William Perkins been stiU aUve w h e n

THE THEATRE MEMORY SYSTEM OF ROBERT FLUDD
M e r s e n n e , in one of his attacks on F l u d d , said that F l u d d ' s two
worlds rested on u n p r o v e n 'Egyptian' teaching (that is teaching in
t h e Hermetica) that m a n contains t h e world, and on t h e statement
of ' M e r c u r i u s ' (in t h e Asclepius) that m a n is a great miracle a n d
like to G o d . M e r s e n n e correctly seized here on t h e H e r m e t i c
basis of F l u d d ' s two worlds. 4 5 I t is because F l u d d ' s m a n as
microcosm potentially contains t h e world that h e can reflect it
within. F l u d d ' s occult art of m e m o r y is an attempt to reproduce or
re-create the macrocosm-microcosm relationship b y establishing,
or composing, or making conscious in t h e m e m o r y of t h e micro-cosm t h e world which h e contains, which is the image of the macro-cosm, which is t h e image of G o d . T h e effort to do this by
manipulating t h e stars in m a n t h r o u g h astralised images in t h e
occult version of t h e art of m e m o r y is t h e basis of all Bruno's
Herculean efforts, which F l u d d is copying.
Yet, t h o u g h B r u n o a n d F l u d d b o t h operate their occult m e m o r y
systems from H e r m e t i c philosophies, those philosophies are n o t
identical. F l u d d ' s outlook is that of the earlier Renaissance, in
which t h e ' t h r e e worlds' or stages of the whole creation—the
elemental world, t h e celestial world, and the supercelestial world—
are Christianised b y identifying the supercelestial world with t h e
Christianised angelic hierarchies of Pseudo-Dionysius. T h i s
allows a placing of Christianised angelic and Trinitarian apex, as it
were, to t h e whole system. Camillo belongs into this outlook. H i s
' T h e a t r e of t h e W o r l d ' connects beyond the stars with sephiroth
and angels w h i c h in t h e m i n d of a Christian Renaissance H e r m e t i c
philosopher are identified with Christian angelic hierarchies w h i c h
are the image of t h e T r i n i t y .
Bruno w h o rejected t h e Christian interpretation of t h e Hermetica
and wished to r e t u r n to a p u r e 'Egyptian' religion, dismissed w h a t
h e called t h e 'metaphysical' apex of t h e system. F o r h i m t h e r e is
beyond t h e celestial world a supercelestial O n e , or an intellectual
Sun, which it is his object to reach t h r o u g h its manifestations or
vestiges in n a t u r e a n d t h r o u g h grouping and unifying these
t h r o u g h their images in m e m o r y .
One of F l u d d ' s illustrations expresses in visual form the reflection
of the three worlds within t h e m i n d and m e m o r y of the microcosm.
H e shows a m a n w h o is first taking in sense impressions from t h e

sensible world or mundus sensibilis t h r o u g h his five senses. N e x t h e
is dealing with these within as images or ' u m b r a ' in a mundus
imaginabilis. I n t h e discussion in t h e text of this mundus imaginabilis F l u d d includes in it t h e reflection of the images of t h e zodiac
and of t h e stars. 4 6 T h e microcosm at this stage is unifying t h e
contents of m e m o r y on the celestial level. T h e n t h e diagram passes
to t h e mens, to t h e intellectual world where a vision is received of
t h e nine celestial hierarchies and of the T r i n i t y . Finally t h e diagram
comes to t h e seat of m e m o r y , at t h e back of t h e head, which
receives all three worlds into itself.
F o r B r u n o , t h e intellectual s u n arrived at by the mens t h r o u g h
the unifying process would n o t have this Christian and Trinita-rian aspect. A n d further, Bruno would abolish, and does abolish in
Seals, t h e divisions of t h e 'faculty psychology' which F l u d d here
partially retains, t h e passage of material from sense impression
t h r o u g h t h e various 'faculties' t h o u g h t of as separate compart-ments within t h e psyche. F o r Bruno there is b u t one power and
one faculty which ranges t h r o u g h all t h e inner world of apprehen-sion, namely t h e imaginative power or t h e imaginative faculty
which passes immediately t h r o u g h t h e gates of m e m o r y and is one
with m e m o r y . 4 7
T h u s F l u d d as H e r m e t i c philosopher and H e r m e t i c psychologist
does n o t speak with quite the same voice as B r u n o . I t is indeed
probable t h a t t h e Hermetic tradition which reached F l u d d was
n o t so m u c h t h e form of it imported b y Bruno as t h a t already
established in England by J o h n D e e . F l u d d has a strong interest in
mechanics a n d in machines (regarded in t h e H e r m e t i c tradition as a
b r a n c h of magic) 4 8 which h a d been characteristic of D e e b u t was
n o t characteristic of Bruno. D e e was also closer to t h e original
Christianised a n d Trinitarian form of the tradition, which B r u n o
discarded, b u t which is still present in F l u d d .
46

See above, pp. 256–7. There is a similar rejection of faculty psycho-logy in Campanella's Del senso delle cose e delle magia (ed A. Bruers, Bari,
1925, P. 96) in a passage where Campanella, in this as in so many other
respects close to Bruno, accuses the faculty psychology of 'making many
souls out of one indivisible soul'.
Fludd's psychology is, however, a fully Renaissance one in its insistence
on the prime importance of imagination.

Nevertheless, in his H e r m e t i c m e m o r y system F l u d d was
influenced by B r u n o , in itself a proof that it was B r u n o m o r e t h a n
any other w h o developed the art of m e m o r y as a H e r m e t i c art.
I n spite of the differences between F l u d d a n d Bruno as H e r m e t i c
philosophers, F l u d d ' s m e m o r y Seal presents us with fundamen-tally t h e same problems as those with which we have tried to
grapple in Bruno. W e can m o r e or less grasp in a general way t h e
nature of the effort m a d e in such a system, b u t t h e detail defeats u s .
Is it p u r e madness to place twenty-four m e m o r y theatres in t h e
zodiac ? O r is it a madness potentially leading to m e t h o d ? O r is
such a system t h e Seal or secret code of a H e r m e t i c sect or society ?
I t is easier to t u r n to t h e historical aspect of t h e p r o b l e m and to
see F l u d d ' s system as t h e recurrence of a p a t t e r n which seems to
r u n t h r o u g h t h e Renaissance. W e saw it first in the M e m o r y
T h e a t r e which Giulio Camillo b r o u g h t as a secret to a K i n g of
France. W e saw it again in t h e M e m o r y Seals which Bruno carried
from country to country. W e see it finally in the T h e a t r e M e m o r y
System in t h e book which F l u d d dedicated to a K i n g of England.
A n d this system contains, as a secret h i d d e n within it, factual
information about t h e G l o b e T h e a t r e .
I t may b e t h a t t h e interest aroused b y this extraordinary fact
will direct intensive research b y m a n y scholars u p o n these prob-lems with w h i c h I have struggled alone, and that t h e n a t u r e and
meaning of Renaissance occult m e m o r y will become clearer in t h e
future t h a n it is to m e .

great wooden public theatres which could hold

t h e English Renaissance were still standing in F l u d d ' s
time a n d still in use. T h e original Globe T h e a t r e , erected
on t h e Bankside in 1599, which was t h e h o m e of t h e L o r d
Chamberlain's company of actors to which Shakespeare belonged
and for which h e wrote his plays, h a d been b u r n e d down in 1613.
T h e Globe was at once rebuilt on t h e same foundations and on t h e

James I contributed a considerable a m o u n t towards t h e cost of

L o r d Chamberlain's company u n d e r his protection and they were
now k n o w n as t h e King's M e n . 3 T h e K i n g would naturally take an
interest in t h e rebuilding of t h e theatre of his own company of
players.
T h e r e has been great interest in recent years in attempted
reconstructions of Elizabethan and Jacobean playhouses, and in
particular of t h e Globe, with its associations with Shakespeare. 4

T h e visual evidence for doing so is scanty; in fact it consists
mainly of one r o u g h sketch of the interior of the Swan theatre, t h e
famous D e W i t t drawing (Pl 19), which has been p o r e d over b y
experts for every scrap of information which it m a y contain. I t
may n o t b e very accurate, and it is a copy of D e W i t t ' s original
sketch (which does n o t exist). Nevertheless it is the best piece of
visual evidence so far available about t h e interior of a public
theatre and all reconstructions take their departure from it. O n t h e
foundation of t h e D e W i t t drawing, of contracts for theatre
buildings, and of analysis for stage directions in the plays, t h e
m o d e r n reconstructions of the Globe have been built u p . T h e
situation is however n o t satisfactory. T h e D e W i t t drawing is
of t h e Swan, n o t of t h e G l o b e ; the building contracts are for t h e
F o r t u n e and t h e H o p e , 5 not for the Globe. N o visual evidence
about t h e interior of t h e Globe has been used for n o n e has been
supposed to exist. Visual evidence about its exterior has b e e n
drawn from early m a p s of L o n d o n in which an object, said to
represent the G l o b e , can b e seen on Bankside. 6 T h e s e maps give
conflicting evidence as to whether the building was r o u n d or
polygonal.
Nevertheless m u c h progress in understanding of what t h e
Globe may have been like has been m a d e . W e know t h a t t h e back

building within which t h e actors changed clothes, kept properties,
and so on. T h i s tiring house wall h a d three levels. O n t h e lowest
level, giving o n to t h e stage, were doors or openings t h o u g h t to b e
probably t h r e e in n u m b e r , perhaps a central door flanked b y two
side entrances. O n e of these doors may have opened to display an

sieges and fights, which could have been battlemented since
'battlements' are mentioned in theatre documents and in plays. 7
T h e r e was also somewhere on this u p p e r level a room, called 'the
c h a m b e r ' , and windows. Above this level again there was a third
tier, and t h e ' h u t s ' containing stage machinery. T h e stage, with
its back wall or frons scaenae formed b y t h e tiring house wall, was
raised on a platform and jutted out into the 'yard', an open space
in the unroofed theatre where stood t h e 'groundlings', that part of
t h e audience w h o paid a small s u m for standing room. T h o s e w h o
could afford seats were accommodated in t h e galleries which ran
r o u n d the building. T h i s general lay-out can b e seen in t h e D e
W i t t drawing of the S w a n ; there is t h e stage with its back wall
formed of t h e wall of t h e tiring house jutting out into t h e y a r d ; and
there are t h e s u r r o u n d i n g galleries. W e see on t h e stage here only
two hinged doors on g r o u n d level and n o evidence of any door
opening to disclose an inner stage. O n t h e u p p e r level there is n o
' c h a m b e r ' , a n d n o windows, b u t only a gallery which appears to
contain spectators b u t which might also have sometimes been used
b y actors. But t h e stage which we are looking at in this drawing is
not t h e stage of t h e Globe.
O n e feature which has come out clearly in t h e reconstructions is
t h a t in these theatres p a r t of t h e stage h a d a covering which
projected from t h e tiring house wall and was supported b y
columns or 'posts' as they were called. 8 T w o such columns or
posts can b e seen o n t h e stage in t h e D e W i t t drawing supporting
such a covering. Only t h e inner part of t h e stage was protected in
this w a y ; t h e outer stage, as can b e seen in t h e D e W i t t drawing,
was uncovered. It is known that t h e underside of this covering was
painted to represent t h e heavens. I n t h e A d a m s reconstruction of
t h e Globe t h e ceiling of t h e inner stage cover is shown as painted
with t h e signs of the zodiac, with some other vaguely arranged
stars within t h e circle of t h e zodiac. 9 Naturally this is a m o d e r n
attempt to reconstruct t h e ceiling; n o specimen of these painted
theatrical heavens has survived. T h e y would certainly not have
shown a vaguely decorative sky indiscriminately sprinkled with
stars. T h e y would have been representations of t h e zodiac with its

twelve signs of t h e spheres of the seven planets within it, perhaps
fairly simple representations, or perhaps sometimes m o r e elabo-r a t e . 1 0 T h i s part of the furnishing of a theatre was called in t h e
contracts and elsewhere 'the h e a v e n s ' ; 1 1 sometimes it was referred
to as 'the shadow'. 1 2
I n an article published in 1958, t h e late Richard Bernheimer
reproduced the engraving of the Theatrum Orbi from F l u d d ' s book.
F r o m his remarks about it I quote t h e following:
That the illustration portrays a structure of generally Elizabethan
type, though an unusual one stylistically, is apparent at first glance.
Shakespearians will recognise the presence of a lower and an upper
stage, of two entrance doors flanking an inner stage, of battlements
fitted for scenes of siege, and of a bay window, out of which Juliet
might lean to drink in the honeyed words of her swain: all things
which none has ever seen, although they have been postulated by
research into stage directions and allusions in dramatic texts. 13
Bernheimer saw something, saw things which, as h e says, no
m o d e r n eye has seen t h o u g h we know from the plays that they m u s t
have existed. Unfortunately, h e spoiled this brilliant intuition b y
making basic mistakes in his interpretation of the engraving and of
F l u d d ' s text.
T h e first mistake was that Bernheimer took t h e engraving to
represent a whole theatre, a very small theatre with boxes at t h e
sides for t h e audience rather like those in a sixteenth-century
10

The so-called English Wagner Book of 1592, which Chambers
thought of some value as evidence about the English theatre, describes a
magical theatre in which were posts and a tiring house and which was
adorned 'with the heavenly firmament, and often spotted with golden
teares which men callen Stars. There was lively portrayed the whole
Imperiall Army of the faire heavenly inhabitants' (Chambers, Elizabethan
Stage, I I I , p. 72).

Perhaps I may be allowed to mention that it was I who drew Profes-sor Bemheimer's attention to the Fludd engraving when he was collecting
theatre material at the Warburg Institute in 1955. I had then myself no
idea of any connection between the engraving and the Globe.
345

FLUDD'S MEMORY THEATRE AND THE GLOBE THEATRE
tennis c o u r t ; whereas t h e engraving does not represent a whole
theatre. I t represents a stage, or rather part of a stage.
T h e second mistake was that Bernheimer, not having served a
t o u g h apprenticeship on Brunian m e m o r y 'Seals', was naturally
baffled by t h e ' r o u n d ' and the 'square' arts. H e saw that F l u d d was
saying a great deal about the ' r o u n d ' and h e t h o u g h t that this m e a n t
that h e was saying that t h e building shown in t h e engraving was
r o u n d . Since there is nothing r o u n d about the building shown in
t h e engraving, Bernheimer leaped to the conclusion that the
engraving bore n o relation to the text. H e assumed that the
G e r m a n printer h a d used some print which h e had b y h i m to
illustrate F l u d d ' s obscure mnemonics, a print (entirely imagined
by Bernheimer) representing a small theatre somewhere in
G e r m a n y which h a d been rigged u p in a tennis court and given
some Elizabethan features to make a visiting company of English
actors feel m o r e at h o m e . By inventing this m y t h , Bernheimer
allowed his remarkable observation about the Shakespearean
character of t h e stage shown in the engraving to evaporate into
nothing. T h e curious way in which he muffled and destroyed
what h e had intuitively seen accounts, I suppose, for the fact that
the Globe reconstructors seem to have taken no notice of his
article and its illustration.
N o w if F l u d d uses, as h e states that h e does, a 'real' public
theatre for t h e stages of his world m e m o r y system (Bernheimer
overlooked this statement) what could be more suitable than the
Globe, t h e most famous of the L o n d o n public theatres and the
very n a m e of which suggests t h e world ? Moreover, since his first
volume was dedicated to James I, would it not have been a good
way of keeping u p that m o n a r c h ' s interest in t h e second volume
to allude in t h e m e m o r y system to t h e newly rebuilt Globe, towards
the erection of which James h a d largely contributed and which was
t h e theatre of his own company of players, t h e King's m e n ?
T h e only features in t h e engraving of t h e Theatrum Orbi which
F l u d d mentions in his text and of which h e makes use in his
mnemonics are t h e five doors or entrances on t h e stage wall and the
five columns 'opposite' to t h e m of which the bases only are shown
in t h e engraving. H e never mentions in the text nor uses in the
mnemonics t h e other features so clearly depicted in t h e engraving
— t h e bay window, t h e battlemented terrace, t h e side walls with
346

FLUDD'S MEMORY THEATRE AND THE GLOBE THEATRE
those openings in their lower part. A n d t h o u g h t h e cinque portae
on t h e stage wall are constantly mentioned—are in fact t h e basis
of t h e scheme of the five m e m o r y loci—he never specifies t h e
differences between t h e cinque portae which are shown in t h e
engraving, never says that t h e central one has those great hinged
doors which we see half opening to disclose an inner room. W h a t
would b e t h e object of showing all these features in t h e engraving,
which h e does not use nor m e n t i o n in t h e text about t h e mne-monics, unless they were 'real' features of a 'real' stage to which h e
wanted to make allusion ?
Moreover, 'real' stages contained t h e feature w h i c h is t h e basis
of t h e ars rotunda, t h e 'heavens' painted on t h e underside of t h e
cover of t h e inner stage. L e t us once m o r e o p e n t h e volume a n d
gaze at t h e diagram of t h e heavens on t h e left-hand page which,
w h e n t h e book is closed, covers t h e stage shown on t h e r i g h t - h a n d
page. Does this arrangement n o t only refer to t h e magic mne-monics, in w h i c h stages like this are placed right a n d left of t h e
signs of t h e zodiac all r o u n d t h e heavens, b u t also refer to t h e
arrangement of a 'real' theatre ? Once one begins to think o n these
lines one is o n t h e road which leads to understanding of t h e
relationship of t h e engraving of t h e Theatrum Orbi to t h e G l o b e
theatre.
The engraving represents that part of the stage of the Globe which
would be covered by the stage 'heavens'.
W h a t w e are seeing as we look straight ahead to t h e back wall is
t h e tiring house wall at t h e Globe, not t h e whole of it b u t only t h e
two lower levels; t h e g r o u n d level with t h e t h r e e e n t r a n c e s ; t h e
second level with t h e terrace and the chamber. W e do n o t see t h e
t h i r d level because we are under the heavens which are projecting
invisibly above us from below t h e third tier of t h e tiring house wall.
T h e r e are five entrances to this stage; three are on g r o u n d level,
a large central door opening to display an inner r o o m , a n d two
other entrances flanking i t ; and there are two entrances on t h e
u p p e r level. T h e s e are t h e cinque portae used as m e m o r y loci in t h e
m e m o r y system. B u t F l u d d is n o t using 'fictitious p l a c e s ' ; h e is
using 'real places'. T h o s e five entrances are real, placed as they
were placed on t h e real stage of t h e Globe. A n d t h e projecting
bay window is r e a l ; it is t h e window of t h e u p p e r ' c h a m b e r ' with
a real battlemented terrace o n either side of it.
But what about t h e side walls of the stage shown in t h e engraving
347

FLUDD'S MEMORY THEATRE AND THE GLOBE THEATRE
with those box-like apertures near their bases ? T h e s e side walls
close t h e stage in a n d make it impossible as an acting space
visible from a whole theatre. A n d w h a t about t h e five columns, of
which only t h e bases are shown, a n d which, if really in t h e positions
shown, would impossibly obstruct an audience's view of t h e stage
from t h e front ?
M y explanation of these features is that they are distortions of
t h e real stage introduced for m n e m o n i c purposes. F l u d d wanted a
' m e m o r y r o o m ' within which to practise his mnemonics w i t h t h e
five doors a n d t h e five columns. H e wanted this ' m e m o r y r o o m '
to b e based o n a real stage b u t closed at t h e sides to form an
enclosed ' m e m o r y theatre', perhaps rather like one of Willis's
m e m o r y theatres or repositories. T o see the real stage of t h e Globe
b e h i n d t h e engraving, one has therefore to remove t h e side walls.
T h e s e side walls m a k e a curious impression. T h e y look some-h o w structurally impossible as t h o u g h there were insufficient
support for their u p p e r expanses above t h e boxes. A n d they do not
fit on properly to t h e e n d wall, for they cut off bits of t h e battle-m e n t s of t h e terrace. T h e y look flimsy as compared with the
solidity of t h e e n d wall. T h e y are to b e swept away as unreal
m n e m o n i c distortions of the real stage. Nevertheless these ima-ginary side walls show a feature of t h e 'real' theatre, namely t h e
boxes or 'gentlemen's r o o m s ' , occupied b y persons of rank a n d
friends of t h e actors, which were situated in t h e galleries on either
side of t h e stage. 1 4
T h e five columns are also unreal, introduced for t h e purposes of
t h e m n e m o n i c s . F l u d d himself says that they are 'feigned'. 1 5
Nevertheless, they too have a 'real' aspect for they are situated on
t h e line o n w h i c h t h e r e would b e o n t h e real stage, n o t five, b u t
two columns or 'posts' rising to s u p p o r t t h e 'heavens'.
O n c e these fundamental points have been grasped—that the
engraving shows t h e tiring house wall at t h e Globe from below t h e
'heavens' a n d that t h e stage has b e e n distorted into a m e m o r y
r o o m — w e can, b y combining t h e F l u d d engraving with t h e D e
W i t t drawing, cause t h e stage of t h e G l o b e to appear out of the
magic m e m o r y system.

side walls are removed and two columns or 'posts' rise to s u p p o r t
t h e 'heavens' above. T h e columns are copied from those in t h e
' T e m p l e of M u s i c ' in t h e first volume of t h e Utriusque Cosmi . . .
Historia. T h e 'heavens' show t h e zodiac and spheres of t h e planets,
as in t h e diagram facing t h e m e m o r y theatre, b u t t h e signs of t h e
zodiac are shown b y their characters only. N o attempt has been
m a d e to represent their images, a n d this is b u t a skeletal outline of
w h a t t h e painted 'heavens' at t h e Globe m a y have b e e n like. T h e
'gentlemen's r o o m s ' or boxes are shown in their p r o p e r place, in
t h e galleries o n either side of t h e stage. Instead of being distorted
into a ' m e m o r y r o o m ' , t h e stage is n o w clearly seen projecting
from t h e tiring house wall into t h e yard, open at t h e sides, and with
posts supporting t h e heavens over the inner stage.
I f this sketch is compared with t h e D e W i t t drawing it can b e
seen to b e in agreement with it in t h e essentials of tiring house
wall, projecting stage, posts, a n d galleries for t h e audience. T h e
only difference—and it is a very big one—is t h a t it shows u s , not t h e
stage of t h e Swan, b u t t h e stage of t h e Globe.
T h e F l u d d engraving t h u s becomes a d o c u m e n t of major im-portance for t h e Shakespearean stage. I t would b e of course t h e
second G l o b e , t h e one rebuilt after t h e fire of 1613 of which F l u d d
wished to r e m i n d James I in this extremely complex way. I t was
in t h e first G l o b e that m a n y of Shakespeare's plays h a d been
acted. H e died in 1616, only three years after t h e b u r n i n g of t h e
first Globe. B u t t h e new theatre used t h e foundations of t h e old
one a n d it is generally assumed that t h e stage and interior of t h e
old Globe were pretty exactly reproduced in t h e new one. I have
n o t disguised t h e fact that t h e F l u d d engraving shows us t h e
stage of t h e second Globe in t h e distorting mirrors of magic
m e m o r y . B u t t h e sketch clears away what I believe to b e t h e m a i n
distortions. F l u d d m e a n t to use a real 'public theatre' in his
m e m o r y s y s t e m ; h e says so, repeatedly emphasising t h a t h e is
using 'real' a n d n o t 'fictitious' places. A n d w h a t h e shows us about
t h e stage of t h e Globe w e either know was there, or has been
conjectured to b e there, t h o u g h t h e exact configuration of entrances
chamber, a n d terrace, has n o t b e e n known.
F l u d d shows us that there were five entrances to t h e stage, three
on g r o u n d level and two on t h e u p p e r level giving on to t h e terrace.
A n d this solves a problem which has worried some scholars w h o
have t h o u g h t that there ought to b e m o r e t h a n three entrances b u t
349

FLUDD'S MEMORY THEATRE AND THE GLOBE THEATRE
there did not seem to b e r o o m for any m o r e on g r o u n d level.
C h a m b e r s suggested that there ought to b e five entrances, corre-sponding to t h e five entrances in t h e frons scaenae of t h e classical
stage. 1 6 T h e classical stage was of course on one level. H e r e we see
t h e classical t h e m e of t h e five entrances of t h e frons scaenae
transposed to t h e multilevel frons scaenae formed b y t h e tiring
house wall of t h e Globe where there are three entrances below a n d
two above. I t is an extremely satisfying solution of t h e p r o b l e m and
one which suggests that, notwithstanding t h e battlements a n d bay
window, there m a y have been some classical a n d Vitruvian elements
in t h e design of t h e Globe.
T h e question of t h e 'inner stages' is one which has m u c h exer-cised scholars. A n extreme form of t h e 'inner stage' theory was p u t
forward b y A d a m s w h o t h o u g h t t h a t there was a large 'inner
stage' opening i n t h e centre on ground level and an ' u p p e r inner
stage' immediately above it. T h i s emphasis o n inner stages is now
rather unfashionable b u t F l u d d shows great hinged doors opening
in t h e centre to display something, and immediately above t h e m
h e shows t h e ' c h a m b e r ' . T h e only alteration or emendation of
F l u d d ' s engraving which is m a d e in t h e sketch is t h e suggestion
that t h e front of t h e bay window (part of which is taken u p in the
engraving b y t h e title) might have opened in two ways, either as
windows opening whilst t h e lower part was closed, or t h e whole
folding right back. T h e bay window could t h e n b e used either for
window scenes (the windows opening separately from t h e doors as
a whole) or w h e n t h e doors were fully opened an ' u p p e r inner
stage' would b e displayed. Such lower and u p p e r inner stages
could have extended right t h r o u g h t h e tiring house to t h e back of
the building w h e r e windows would have lighted t h e m from t h e back.
T h e position of t h e c h a m b e r as shown b y F l u d d solves what has
been one of t h e major problems of Shakespearean staging. I t has
been k n o w n that there was a terrace on t h e u p p e r level which was
thought to r u n right across it, a n d k n o w n also that there was an
u p p e r chamber. I t has been t h o u g h t that this chamber was placed
b e h i n d t h e terrace which with its railings or balusters (or rather, as
we n o w see, its battlements) would obscure t h e view into t h e
chamber. 1 7 F l u d d shows us that t h e terrace ran behind t h e front

p a r t of t h e chamber which projected beyond it over t h e m a i n stage.
T h e terrace as it were passed through t h e chamber which could b e
entered from it on either side (entrances which could b e curtained
off w h e n t h e whole chamber was being used as an u p p e r inner
stage). N o one has thought of this solution of t h e chamber a n d
terrace p r o b l e m which is obviously t h e right one.
T h e corbelled projecting window over a great gate was a familiar
feature of T u d o r architecture. A n example at H e n g r a v e H a l l
(1536) shows corbelled projecting windows in a gatehouse w i t h
battlements. 1 8 T h e gatehouse has been said to b e a chief feature of
English great houses of t h e sixteenth century ; 1 9 it was a descendant
of t h e fortified a n d battlemented gatehouses of earlier times a n d
often retained t h e battlements. Another example of a gatehouse-like entrance to a great house with projecting corbelled window
above it is Bramshill, H a n t s (1605–12) 2 0 which w i t h its t h r e e
entrances a n d terrace on either side of t h e corbelled window is
reminiscent of t h e stage shown b y F l u d d . T h e s e comparisons are
introduced to suggest that t h e stage wall revealed to us b y F l u d d
has something of t h e attributes of the gatehouse or entrance to a
great contemporary mansion, yet it could easily t u r n into t h e
battlemented a n d fortified entrance to town or castle. I also make
these comparisons in order to point out that in b o t h t h e examples
mentioned t h e corbel u n d e r t h e projecting window over t h e gate
comes d o w n to t h e t o p of t h e gate, which makes one w o n d e r
whether t h e central door or gate shown in t h e F l u d d engraving is
too small a n d o u g h t to b e extended u p to the base of t h e corbel, as
suggested in t h e sketch.
Bernheimer t h o u g h t h e saw G e r m a n influence in t h e corbel
u n d e r t h e bay w i n d o w in t h e engraving. 2 1 I n view of t h e
English examples h e r e cited it is perhaps unnecessary t o
suppose this, t h o u g h t h e possibility of some influence on t h e
engraving at t h e G e r m a n e n d of t h e publication cannot b e entirely
excluded.
T h e final touch to t h e stage architecture in F l u d d ' s engraving is

added by the fashionable Italianate effect of 'rustication' shown on
t h e walls (this is roughly reproduced in t h e sketch). W e know
that the great wooden public theatres were covered with painted
canvas. T h e effect here shown m u s t b e rather similar to that
created for a wooden banqueting house erected at Westminster in
1581 which h a d walls 'closed with canuas, and painted all t h e outsides of t h e same m o s t artificiallie with a worke called rustike,
m u c h like to s t o n e ' . 2 2 O n e wonders whether t h e imitation 'rustic
work' which F l u d d shows was one of t h e expensive improvements
m a d e in t h e second Globe. T h e use of t h e rustication with battle-m e n t s and bay w i n d o w gives an extraordinarily hybrid effect to the
whole, b u t shows once again t h a t t h e illusion aimed at was that of a
great m o d e r n mansion, which yet could b e easily switched to
present t h e sterner aspect of fortified castle or town.
T h o u g h m n e m o n i c distortions, G e r m a n influences, a n d the
splendours of t h e second Globe may come to some extent between
F l u d d ' s engraving and Shakespeare's original theatre, there can b e
no d o u b t that this H e r m e t i c philosopher has shown us m o r e of it
t h a n we have ever seen before. F l u d d is in fact t h e only person
w h o has left us any visual record at all of the stage on which t h e
plays of t h e world's greatest dramatist were acted.
W e can therefore begin to people this stage with scenes. T h e r e
are t h e doors o n g r o u n d level for t h e street scenes, doors at which
people knock, at w h i c h they talk in t h e 'threshold' scenes. T h e r e is
t h e ' p e n t h o u s e ' , formed b y t h e projecting bay window, which
affords shelter from t h e rain. T h e r e are t h e battlemented walls of
city or castle w i t h projecting bastion (entered b y defenders from
t h e terrace) a n d u n d e r it t h e great city or castle gate, all ready for
historical scenes of siege or battle. Or, if we are in Verona, there is
t h e H o u s e of Capulet with its lower r o o m where they prepared
t h e b a n q u e t a n d its u p p e r c h a m b e r from t h e window of which
Juliet leaned ' o n such a night as this'. Or, if we are at Elsinore,
there are t h e ramparts on which H a m l e t and Horatio were con-versing w h e n H a m l e t saw t h e Ghost. O r if we are in R o m e , there
is t h e r o s t r u m from which M a r k Antony addressed friends,
R o m a n s , citizens, on t h e stage below. O r if we are in L o n d o n ,
there is t h e u p p e r room of t h e Boar's H e a d T a v e r n in Eastcheap.

O r if we are in Egypt, c h a m b e r and terrace are dressed to hold
the m o n u m e n t in which Cleopatra died. 2 3
W e have n o w to direct our gaze on the other two 'theatres'
(P1. 18a, b) w h i c h F l u d d illustrates in his m e m o r y system. T h e s e are
one level stages, one having five entrances, t h e other, three
entrances. T h e one with five entrances has bases of imaginary
columns opposite to t h e m , after t h e m a n n e r of t h e m a i n theatre.
T h e s e subsidiary theatres were to b e used in t h e m e m o r y system
with t h e m a i n theatre with which, as we noted before, they have
a m a t c h i n g relationship t h r o u g h t h e battlements o n their walls
similar to those on t h e terrace. T h e s e theatres are also covered with
canvas painted to resemble, in one case stone walls, in t h e other
case, wooden walls of which t h e carefully jointed timbers are
shown.
H e r e I m u s t interpolate that t h e m e m o r y treatises often advise
that m e m o r y places are better r e m e m b e r e d if they are r e m e m b e r e d
as m a d e of different materials. 2 4 F l u d d has distinguished between
his m e m o r y theatres b y making t h e m a i n one of 'rustic work' and
t h e subsidiary ones of plain stone blocks and wooden beams
respectively. Nevertheless, as always, F l u d d insists that these
secondary theatres too are 'real' and n o t fictitious places. O n e is
labelled as ' t h e figure of a t r u e t h e a t r e ' . 2 5 T h e subsidiary theatres
are therefore, like t h e m a i n one, n o t only magic m e m o r y theatres
b u t reflections of something 'real' or t r u e seen at t h e Globe.
Shakespearean scholars have puzzled as to h o w localities were
indicated on t h e m a i n stage. A case in point is that of t h e Capulet
orchard which h a d walls which R o m e o leaped in order to come
u n d e r Juliet's window. C h a m b e r s suggested that h e m u s t have
h a d a wall to leap and pointed to m a n y other scenes, such as those
showing camps of rival armies, which seem to d e m a n d differentia-tion b y walls or some kind of divisions. H e conjectured t h a t
possibly scenic constructions resembling walls were b r o u g h t on to
23

The plays alluded to here, though some of them may have been first
produced at other theatres than the Globe were all, almost certainly,
played at some time at the Globe. Shakespearean drama was also, of course,
played at the court and, after 1608, at the Blackfriars theatre.

t h e stage. 2 6 A n d n u m e r o u s references to 'battlements' as scenic
units have been collected from theatre documents b y G l y n n
Wickham. 2 7
I suggest t h a t F l u d d ' s two subsidiary m e m o r y theatres reflect
such scenic constructions, or screens, resembling battlemented
walls. T h e y would b e m a d e of light wooden frames covered with
painted canvas a n d easily moveable. F l u d d makes a very i m p o r t a n t
revelation about such constructions b y showing t h a t they h a d
entrances a n d so could b e used for playing scenes in which
entrances a n d exits are m a d e . T h e y could have been placed before-h a n d on t h e stage to provide for scenes required b y a play which
were not playable with t h e facilities provided b y t h e m a i n frons
scaenae. F o r example, extra scenes representing t h e Capulet
orchard and t h e Friar's cell—which was in t h e country, to which
his visitors m a d e their way and entered b y a door—would b e
required for Romeo and Juliet. O r take t h e case of t h e camps of
rival armies between which t h e scenes change so rapidly in Richard
III; t h e p r o b l e m of h o w such scenes were staged is solved if we
can think of constructions such as F l u d d ' s subsidiary theatres
being used for t h e rival camps.
Again, F l u d d has shown us something for which n o visual
evidence has hitherto existed. T h a t h e makes his battlemented
subsidiary theatres m a t c h t h e m a i n theatre with its battlemented
terrace suggests t h a t these scenic constructions were t h o u g h t of as
an integral p a r t of t h e stage as a whole. T h i s revelation, like his
revelation of t h e relationship between terrace a n d chamber, m a y
m a k e it possible to u n d e r s t a n d t h e changes of scene in Shakes-peare's plays m o r e clearly t h a n ever before.
D o e s F l u d d , w h o tells us so m u c h about t h e stage, have nothing
to tell u s about t h e shape a n d plan of t h e Globe T h e a t r e as a
whole ? I believe that if one sets about it carefully a n d methodi-cally one can d r a w out of F l u d d ' s evidence sufficient information
to enable one to draw a plan of t h e whole theatre, n o t of course a
detailed architect's plan showing position of staircases a n d t h e like,
b u t a plan of t h e basic geometrical forms used in t h e construction
of t h e theatre. I believe t h a t F l u d d gives information about t h e

of t h e five column bases which h e m e n t i o n s ; a n d secondly t h r o u g h
his strong insistence that there were five entrances to t h e frons
scaenae.
T h e five column bases shown in t h e engraving of t h e Theatrum
Orbi are r o u n d , square, hexagonal, square, r o u n d . T h o s e are their
shapes, not only as shown in t h e engraving b u t as stated in t h e
text.
T h e only visual evidence about t h e external shape of t h e Globe
is to b e found, as already mentioned, in those early m a p s of
L o n d o n in which small representations of t h e theatre are shown o n
Bankside. I n some maps t h e Globe is indicated as a polygonal
b u i l d i n g ; in others as a r o u n d building. Poring over t h e indistinct
forms shown o n t h e m a p s Adams believed t h a t h e could detect
eight sides o n one of t h e m , and h e therefore based his elaborate
reconstruction of t h e Globe on an octagon. Others have preferred
t h e r o u n d G l o b e theory. T h e evidence of t h e maps is really quite
inconclusive.
W e do however possess a statement by an eyewitness about t h e
shape of t h e G l o b e , t h o u g h some scholars have t h o u g h t it un-reliable. D r . Johnson's friend, Hester T h r a l e , lived in t h e m i d eighteenth century near t h e site of the Globe which h a d b e e n
demolished in 1644, u n d e r t h e Commonwealth, b u t of which
some remains could still b e seen in h e r time, remains which she
describes as a 'black h e a p of rubbish'. M r s . T h r a l e took a romantic
interest in t h e old theatre about which she makes this statement:
' T h e r e were really curious remains of t h e old Globe Playhouse,
which, t h o u g h hexagonal in form without, was r o u n d w i t h i n . ' 2 8
Encouraged b y M r s . T h r a l e , I believe t h a t F l u d d is stating
t h r o u g h t h e shapes of t h e five column bases t h e geometrical forms
used in t h e construction of t h e Globe, namely t h e hexagon, t h e
circle, and t h e square.
L e t us n o w p o n d e r o n t h e fact on which F l u d d insists so
strongly, namely t h a t t h e r e were five entrances to t h e stage shown
in his engraving. F l u d d ' s evidence about this very satisfactorily
solves the problem raised b y C h a m b e r s , that the Globe stage o u g h t
to have h a d five entrances, like t h e classical theatre. I t did have
five entrances, n o t as in t h e classical stage all on g r o u n d level, b u t

t h e basic difference from the classical stage, d u e to t h e multilevel

Vitruvian a n d classical influence on its design ?

four triangles are shown in Palladio's reconstruction of t h e
Vitruvian theatre illustrated b y a diagram in Barbara's com-mentary on Vitruvius (P1. 9a), first published in 1556. 2 9 H e r e we
see how t h e base of one triangle determines t h e line of t h e frons
scaenae whilst its apex points to the m a i n gangway in t h e audito-rium. T h r e e triangle apices determine the positions of t h e t h r e e
m a i n entrances or doors in t h e frons scaenae. T w o other triangle
apices determine t h e two entrances to the stage from t h e sides. Six
other triangle apices determine six gangways in t h e auditorium
(the main central one making t h e seventh, determined b y t h e
triangle t h e base of which determined t h e position of t h e frons
scaenae). Vitruvius likens these four triangles to t h e triangles
inscribed b y astrologers within t h e zodiac to form t h e trigona of t h e
signs (triangles connecting related signs of t h e zodiac with one
another). 3 0 T h e classical stage was t h u s planned in accordance
with t h e fabrica mundi, to reflect t h e proportions of t h e world. M a y
we n o t assume t h a t t h e Globe theatre, with its 'heavens' over part
of t h e stage, would also have been planned in accordance with t h e
fahrica mundi, as was t h e classical stage, a n d t h a t t h e four triangles
inscribed within a circle would have played a part in determining
its frons scaenae and gangways ?
T h e a t t e m p t here m a d e to draw a suggested plan of t h e G l o b e
works on t h e assumption that this theatre was an adaptation of t h e
Vitruvian theatre. I t would have to b e an adaptation, for t h e stage of
this theatre, unlike t h a t of the classical theatre, was n o t all o n one
level; a n d t h e galleries of its auditorium also consisted of super29
Some modern authorities interpret Vitruvius as saying that the
triangles are inscribed within the circle of the orchestra. Palladio, in this
diagram, interprets him as saying that the triangles are inscribed within
the circle of the whole theatre. We follow Palladio's diagram which might
have been known to the designers of the Globe.

imposed galleries, not of the rising graded seating of the classical
theatre.
T h e other assumption m a d e in drawing the plan is that F l u d d
gives information t h a t t h e basic geometrical forms used in t h e
construction of t h e Globe were t h e hexagon, t h e circle, a n d t h e
square.
A n d thirdly, t h e plan utilises dimensions given in t h e contract
for t h e building of t h e F o r t u n e theatre. 3 1 T h e F o r t u n e contract
has always been a m a i n source for Globe reconstructors because it
states in two places t h a t certain of its specifications are to b e like
what has been d o n e at t h e Globe. T h i s contract is, however, a
confusing d o c u m e n t from t h e point of view of t h e Globe reconstructor because (1) t h e F o r t u n e was a square theatre and so cannot
have been exactly like t h e G l o b e ; (2) its statements are often
vaguely phrased, a n d it is n o t at all clear, to m y m i n d at least, which
parts of it are being m a d e like t h e Globe. Nevertheless the dimen-sions which it specifies cannot b e ignored. T h e F o r t u n e contract
gives a dimension of 43 feet for t h e stage which is to 'extend to t h e
middle of t h e y a r d ' ; a n d a dimension of 80 feet for the size of the
square of which t h e theatre is formed, with an inner square of 55
feet arrived at b y t h e subtraction of t h e width of t h e galleries. T h e
plan of t h e G l o b e here attempted keeps t h e dimension of 43 feet
for t h e stage, b u t increases t h e total dimension of 80 feet given for
t h e square F o r t u n e to a dimension of 86 feet for t h e diameter of t h e
circle formed b y t h e outer wall of t h e galleries in this theatre,
which we believe was r o u n d within and hexagonal without.
T h e n e w plan of t h e Globe (Fig. 11) is based on a hexagon as t h e
external form of t h e theatre. W i t h i n t h e hexagon is inscribed a
circle (the outer wall of t h e galleries). Within t h e circle are ins-cribed four triangles; t h e base of one gives t h e position of t h e
frons scaenae; its apex points to t h e opposite part of t h e audito-r i u m ; six other triangle apices point towards other parts of t h e
auditorium. O n t h e inner circle, which marks t h e b o u n d a r y
between t h e galleries a n d t h e yard, seven openings are indicated,
opposite t h e apices of t h e seven triangles. T h e s e , it is suggested,
m a r k gangways between seats i n t h e galleries whose positions
are determined b y t h e triangles, like t h e gangways in a classical
theatre. T w o such entries, m a r k e d 'ingressus' can b e seen in t h e

t h e remaining t w o triangle apices do not mark e n t r a n c e s ; in t h e
classical theatre they would m a r k side entrances to t h e stage, b u t
at t h e Globe t h e other two entrances to the stage were on t h e u p p e r
level, immediately above t h e two entrances flanking t h e m a i n
entrance on g r o u n d level. T h u s t h e five entrances at t h e G l o b e
needed only three triangle apices to m a r k their positions. I t is a
deviation from t h e classical theatre d u e to t h e multilevel stage.
T h e square includes b o t h tiring house and stage, and is b o u n d e d
at t h e back b y t h e outer hexagonal wall. Since there were acting
areas within t h e tiring h o u s e it m a y perhaps b e said that t h e square
is t h e stage as a whole. T h e p a r t of it in front of t h e frons scaenae is a
rectangle jutting o u t into t h e m i d d l e of t h e yard. T h e front of t h e
stage is o n t h e diameter of t h e yard, just as t h e proscenium of t h e
classical stage was o n t h e diameter of t h e orchestra. T h e two r o u n d

'posts' indicate t h e point at which t h e stage cover, or 'heavens',
ends. T h e s e column bases, actually marking t h e real 'posts', also
indicate which part of the theatre is shown in t h e F l u d d engraving.
N o a t t e m p t is m a d e to suggest the position of door or doors into
t h e theatre n o r any architectural details at all. I t is simply a plan
of basic geometrical forms. But I believe that t h e Vitruvian
zodiacal triangles a n d F l u d d ' s symbolic geometry m a y b e safer
and m o r e stable guides to t h e basic plan of t h e Globe t h a n t h e
indistinct m a p s a n d indistinct contracts on which reconstructions
have hitherto b e e n based.
I t is very interesting to realise how closely t h e Globe comes out
as an adaptation of Vitruvius. If this plan is compared with t h e
Palladian plan of t h e Vitruvian theatre (P1. 9a) it can b e seen t h a t
b o t h plans have to solve t h e problem of placing a stage a n d a
stage building in relation to a circle, and they solve it in m u c h t h e
same way. Except t h a t t h e Globe seats its audience in superim-posed galleries a n d t h e Globe has a multilevel stage. Also t h e
hexagonal outline of t h e Globe enables it to get in a square, which
is just not obtainable within t h e circle of the Vitruvian theatre plan.
T h i s square is highly significant, for it relates t h e Shakespearean
theatre to t h e t e m p l e a n d t h e church. I n his t h i r d book on temples,
Vitruvius describes h o w t h e figure of a m a n with extended arms
and legs fits exactly into a square or a circle. I n t h e Italian Renais-sance, this Vitruvian image of M a n within t h e square or t h e circle
became t h e favourite expression of t h e relation of t h e microcosm
to t h e macrocosm, or, as Rudolf Wittkower puts it, 'invigorated
by t h e Christian belief that M a n as t h e image of G o d embodied
t h e harmonies of t h e Universe, t h e Vitruvian figure inscribed in a
square and a circle became a symbol of the mathematical sympathy
between microcosm a n d macrocosm. H o w could t h e relation of
M a n to G o d b e better e x p r e s s e d . . . t h a n by building t h e house of
G o d in accordance with t h e fundamental geometry of square a n d
circle ?' 3 2 T h i s was t h e preoccupation of all t h e great Renaissance
architects. A n d it was evidently t h e preoccupation of t h e designers
of t h e Globe T h e a t r e .

theatres of t h e English Renaissance begins to seem singularly

inadequate, 3 3 t h o u g h it m a y still account for some things, perhaps
for t h e galleries, and for the use of the word 'yard' for t h e orches-tra. T h e very a t t e m p t to build large theatres in wood shows
classical influence, for Vitruvius states that m a n y of t h e 'public
theatres' in R o m e were built of wood. 3 4 A n d t h e remarks of foreign
visitors w h e n surveying t h e m a n y L o n d o n public theatres indicate
that they saw classical influence in them. D e W i t t speaks of t h e
'amphitheatres' of L o n d o n . 3 5 A traveller w h o visited L o n d o n in
1600 says t h a t h e saw an English comedy in a theatre 'constructed
in wood after t h e m a n n e r of t h e ancient R o m a n s ' . 3 6 A n d t h e design
of the Globe as revealed by F l u d d seems to suggest a knowledge,
not only of Vitruvius, b u t also of interpretations of Vitruvius in t h e
Italian Renaissance.
T h e first of t h e wooden theatres of t h e EngUsh Renaissance was
the ' T h e a t e r ' w h i c h was built by James Burbage in 1576 in S h o r e ditch. 3 7 T h e ' T h e a t e r ' was t h e prototype of all t h e new style
wooden theatres. Moreover it was particularly associated with t h e
origins of t h e G l o b e , for timber from t h e ' T h e a t e r ' was carried
across the river a n d used in the building of t h e first Globe on
Bankside in 1599. 3 8 I f w e are to look for influences from t h e
Italian Renaissance revival of Vitruvius on the origins of t h e G l o b e ,
these should b e available before 1576, w h e n t h e ' T h e a t e r ' was
built. As well as Shute's book on architecture (1563) a source in
England of such influences would have been t h e H e r m e t i c philoso-p h e r J o h n D e e , t h e teacher of Philip Sidney and his circle.

of being of practical utility to artisans. I n this preface D e e makes

D e e is here using, n o t only 'Vitruuius the Romaine' b u t also ' L e o

A vast subject is opened u p here, and one at which I can only

would devolve on an artisan, a carpenter like James Burbage, to
introduce t h e t r u e Renaissance architecture of t h e Elizabethan
age, t h e wooden theatre architecture. Was it also Burbage (perhaps
with t h e advice of Dee) w h o adapted Vitruvius b y combining t h e
classical theatre with a heritage from t h e mediaeval religious
theatre, t h e multilevel stage ? 4 4 I t was this adaptation which m a d e of

t h e Shakespearean theatre a marvellous synthesis of t h e immediate
contact between players a n d audience of the classical theatre with a
hint of t h e hierarchy of spiritual levels expressed in t h e old religious
theatre.
T h o u g h t h e first G l o b e would have carried on traditions b e g u n
b y t h e first ' a m p h i t h e a t r e ' , it was a new theatre, a n d generally
regarded as t h e best and most successful of t h e theatres. I t was t h e
theatre of which Shakespeare was joint o w n e r ; it is even con-ceivable that h e m i g h t have h a d some influence on its design. A n d
t h e Globe (judging b y F l u d d ' s reflection of t h e second Globe)
shows that t h e Shakespearean theatre was not an imitation b u t an
adaptation of Vitruvius. A p a r t from t h e change on the from scaenae
from a classical building to a battlemented and bay-windowed
mansion, there was t h e basic change introduced b y t h e multilevel
stage. T h e old religious theatre showed a spiritual drama of t h e
soul of m a n in relation to t h e levels of Hell, Purgatory, and Para-dise. A Renaissance theatre like t h e Globe also expressed t h e
spiritual d r a m a , b u t in relation to t h e changed Renaissance out-look which approached reUgious t r u t h t h r o u g h t h e world, t h r o u g h
t h e fabrica mundi.
T h e Shakespearean theatre was a splendid theatre, an adaptation
of Vitruvius superior to t h e picture stage within t h e proscenium
arch, which lost t h e t r u e Vitruvian quaUties. Yet t h e picture stage
theatre would supplant t h e Globe type of theatre for centuries, h a d
indeed already supplanted it w h e n t h e F l u d d engraving was
Renaissance italienne' in Le Lieu Théâtral à la Renaissance, ed. J. Jacquot,
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1964, pp. 49–60).
Evidence could, I think be gathered from Dee's Preface that he knew
Daniele Barbaro's commentary on Vitruvius, the book which contains
Palladio's reconstruction of the Roman theatre (P1. 9a). When speaking
of Vitruvius's dedication of his work to Augustus, Dee adds 'in whose
daies our Heauenly Archemaster was borne' (Preface, sig. d iii recto).
Barbaro, at the beginning of his commentary (p. 2 in the edition of Venice,
1567) dwells on the universal peace of the Augustan age 'in which time
Our Lord Jesus Christ was born'.
It may be of significance that, according to Anthony à Wood (Athenae
Oxonienses, London, 1691, cols. 284–5) Billingsley was assisted in his
mathematical work on Euclid by an Austin Friar named Whytehead who
had been expelled from his convent in Oxford in the time of Henry VIII
and lived in Billingsley's house in London. In the background of this
circle, there was thus an expert on number and its symbolic meaning
surviving from the old pre-Reformation world.

hitherto been available for t h e reconstruction of t h e Shakespear-ean type of theatre. T h i s material consists, first of all, of t h e
engravings in F l u d d ' s m e m o r y system, and secondly of t h e use of
D e e ' s preface to Billingsley's Euclid as evidence that it was D e e
(and n o t Inigo Jones) w h o was t h e first 'Vitruvius Britannicus',
a n d t h a t therefore Vitruvian influences were available to t h e
designers of t h e first Elizabethan T h e a t r e a n d its successors. T h e

in this way t h e subject will n o d o u b t b e advanced further t h a n I

on Vitruvian influences in b o t h D e e and F l u d d .
I have h a d to compress t h e chapter as m u c h as possible lest this
book, w h i c h is a b o u t t h e history of t h e art of m e m o r y , should lose its
bearings. Yet this chapter h a d to b e in this book, because it is only
in t h e context of t h e history of t h e art of m e m o r y that t h e relation-ship of F l u d d ' s m e m o r y system to a real theatre can b e understood.
I t is in strict p u r s u a n c e of t h e history of the art of m e m o r y that we
have found ourselves introduced into t h e Shakespearean theatre. T o
w h o m do we owe this extraordinary experience ? T o Simonides of
Ceos and M e t r o d o r u s of Scepsis; to ' T u l l i u s ' and T h o m a s
A q u i n a s ; to Giulio Camillo and Giordano Bruno. F o r unless we
h a d travelled on o u r long journey with the art of m e m o r y down t h e
ages, t h o u g h w e m i g h t have seen something exciting in t h e F l u d d
engraving (as Bernheimer did) we could not have understood it.
I t is with t h e tools forged in following the history of t h e art of
m e m o r y t h a t we have been able to excavate the Globe theatre
from its hiding place in F l u d d ' s Utriusque Cosmi. . . Historia.
I t has been well a n d truly h i d d e n there for three a n d a half
centuries. A n d here t h e question arises which has always baffled us
in studying B r u n o ' s m e m o r y Seals. W e r e these fantastic occult
m e m o r y systems deliberately m a d e impossible and inscrutable in
order to hide a secret ? Is F l u d d ' s system of t h e twenty-four
m e m o r y theatres i n t h e zodiac a n elaborate casket deliberately
contrived to conceal his allusion to t h e Globe theatre from all b u t
t h e iniated, of w h o m w e m u s t suppose that James I was one ?
As I have said before, I think t h a t although t h e Renaissance
H e r m e t i c tradition was becoming m o r e and m o r e of a secret in t h e
late Renaissance, t h e occult m e m o r y system is n o t to b e entirely
accounted for as a cipher. T h e occult m e m o r y belongs into t h e
Renaissance as a whole. I t was t h e Renaissance on the H e r m e t i c
side as a whole, t h e secret of its inner stimulus to the imagination,
which Giordano B r u n o b r o u g h t with h i m to England, a n d I would
see in Bruno's visit a n d in t h e 'Scepsian' controversies aroused b y
his Seals a basic factor in t h e formation of Shakespeare. I would
also suggest t h a t t h e two native H e r m e t i c philosophers, J o h n D e e
a n d R o b e r t F l u d d , o u g h t not to b e excluded from t h e attention of
those interested in t h e English Renaissance. I t may b e because they
have been excluded t h a t t h e secret of Shakespeare has b e e n missed.

FLUDD'S MEMORY THEATRE AND THE GLOBE THEATRE
T h e revelation of t h e Globe within t h e last of t h e Seals of
M e m o r y would b e incomprehensible and unbelievable if presented
without preparation, yet it has an intelligible historical context
within t h e history of t h e art of m e m o r y , and it is this which alone
concerns us in t h e concluding pages of this chapter.
Camillo's T h e a t r e is in m a n y ways analogous to F l u d d ' s
T h e a t r e system. T h e r e is in b o t h cases a distortion of a 'real'
theatre for t h e purposes of a Hermetic m e m o r y system. Camillo
distorts t h e Vitruvian theatre by transferring t h e practice of deco-rating with imagery t h e five entrances to its stage to t h e seven
times seven imaginary gates which h e erects in t h e auditorium.
F l u d d stands with his back to the auditorium a n d looking towards
t h e stage, loading with imaginary imagery its five doors, used as
m e m o r y loci, a n d distorting t h e stage for his m n e m o n i c purposes
by crushing it into a m e m o r y room. I n b o t h cases t h e r e is a
distortion of a real theatre, t h o u g h the distortions are of a different
kind.
Camillo's T h e a t r e rises in t h e midst of t h e Venetian Renaissance
and is immediately derivative from t h e m o v e m e n t initiated b y
Ficino a n d Pico. I t arouses immense admiration a n d interest a n d
seems to belong naturally with those powerful manifestations of
t h e creative imagination which we see at that stage in t h e Italian
Renaissance. A d m i r e d b y Ariosto and Tasso, its architectural form
was related to t h e neoclassical architecture out of which was soon
to develop a significant 'real' theatre, t h e T e a t r o Olimpico.
F l u d d ' s T h e a t r e m e m o r y system arises within a philosophy which
is very closely derivative from t h e earlier Renaissance tradition.
A n d it uses t h e type of theatre which h a d housed t h e s u p r e m e
achievement of a very late Renaissance. W h e n we meditate as best
we can on this comparison, it begins to seem after all historically
right that F l u d d ' s H e r m e t i c m e m o r y systemshouldreflect t h e Globe.
T h e question to which I can give n o clear or satisfactory answer
i s : W h a t was t h e occult m e m o r y ? D i d t h e change from forming
corporeal similitudes of t h e intelligible world to the effort to grasp
t h e intelligible world t h r o u g h t r e m e n d o u s imaginative exercises
such as those to which Giordano B r u n o devoted his life really
stimulate the h u m a n psyche to a wider range of creative imagina-tive achievement t h a n ever before ? W a s this t h e secret of t h e
Renaissance and does t h e occult m e m o r y represent that secret ?
I b e q u e a t h this p r o b l e m to others.

THE ART OF MEMORY AND
THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC
METHOD

I

T H A S b e e n t h e p u r p o s e of this book to show t h e place of
t h e art of m e m o r y at t h e great nerve centres of the E u r o p e a n
tradition. I n t h e M i d d l e Ages it was central, with its theory
formulated b y t h e scholastics and its practice connected with
mediaeval imagery in art and architecture as a whole and with
great literary m o n u m e n t s such as D a n t e ' s Divine Comedy. At t h e
Renaissance its importance dwindled in t h e purely h u m a n i s t
tradition b u t grew to vast proportions in the H e r m e t i c tradition.
N o w t h a t we are already in t h e seventeenth century in t h e course
of our history will it finally disappear, or survive only marginally
a n d n o t at t h e centre ? R o b e r t F l u d d is a last outpost of t h e full
Renaissance H e r m e t i c tradition. H e is in conflict with representa-tives of t h e new scientific movement, with Kepler a n d M e r s e n n e .
Is his H e r m e t i c m e m o r y system, based on t h e Shakespearean G l o b e
T h e a t r e , also a last outpost of t h e art of m e m o r y itself, a signal
that t h e ancient art of Simonides is about to be p u t aside as an ana-chronism in t h e seventeenth century advance ?
I t is a curious and significant fact t h a t t h e art of m e m o r y is
known and discussed in the seventeenth century not only, as we
should expect, b y a writer like R o b e r t F l u d d w h o is still following
t h e Renaissance tradition, b u t also b y t h e thinkers who are t u r n i n g
in t h e new directions, b y Francis Bacon, b y Descartes, by Leibniz.

encyclopaedia of knowledge, of reflecting t h e world in m e m o r y , to
an aid for investigating t h e encyclopaedia a n d t h e world with t h e
object of discovering new knowledge. I t is fascinating to watch
how, in t h e trends of t h e n e w century, t h e art of m e m o r y survives
as a factor in t h e growth of scientific method.
I n this concluding chapter, which comes as a postscript to t h e
main p a r t of t h e book, I can only briefly indicate t h e importance
of t h e art of m e m o r y in this n e w rôle. Insufficient t h o u g h it is, this
chapter m u s t b e attempted because in t h e seventeenth century t h e
art of m e m o r y is still in a significant position in a major E u r o p e a n
development. O u r history which began with Simonides m u s t not
end before Leibniz.
T h e w o r d ' m e t h o d ' was popularised by R a m u s . W e saw in an
earlier chapter 1 t h a t t h e r e is a close connection between R a m i s m
and t h e art of m e m o r y a n d t h a t this alone might suggest a connec-tion between t h e history of m e m o r y and t h e history of m e t h o d .
But t h e w o r d was also used of Lullism a n d Cabalism w h i c h
flourished in t h e Renaissance in close association with m e m o r y .
T o give one example out of t h e m a n y which might b e cited, t h e r e
is t h e 'circular m e t h o d ' for knowing everything described b y
Cornelius G e m m a in his De arte cyclognomica2 which is a com-p o u n d of Lullism, H e r m e t i s m , Cabalism, and the art of m e m o r y ,
T h i s work m a y have influenced B r u n o w h o also calls his procedures
a ' m e t h o d ' , 3 and t h e use of this w o r d for modes of thinking w h i c h
would seem to have little connection with the n e w mathematical
m e t h o d was widely prevalent in the seventeenth century as t h e
following anecdote will illustrate.
W h e n t h e m e m b e r s of a small private academy in Paris assem-bled for their first meeting, about the year 1632, the subject of
their deliberations was ' m e t h o d ' . T h e conference began with a
highly abbreviated reference t o the 'method of t h e Cabbalists'
who from the archetypal world descend to the intellectual world
and thence to t h e elemental w o r l d ; the members then passed to an
equally rapid characterisation of the 'method of R a m o n L u l l ' ,
based on divine a t t r i b u t e s ; and thence to what they described as
'the m e t h o d of ordinary philosophy'. I n the published account of

dismissed are u n w o r t h y of attention save as an indication of h o w
little surprise w o u l d have been aroused b y t h e title Discours de la
méthode of t h e book published five years later b y Descartes.
Amongst t h e n u m e r o u s ' m e t h o d s ' circulating in t h e early
seventeenth century, t h e art of m e m o r y was p r o m i n e n t a n d so also
was t h e art of R a m o n Lull. T h e s e two great mediaeval arts, w h i c h
the Renaissance h a d tried to combine, t u r n into m e t h o d s in t h e
seventeenth century a n d play their part in t h e methodological
revolution. 5
Francis Bacon h a d a very full knowledge of the art of m e m o r y
a n d himself used it. 6 T h e r e is indeed in A u b r e y ' s life of Bacon
one of the few evidences of t h e actual design of a building for use in
'local m e m o r y ' . A u b r e y says that in one of t h e galleries in Bacon's
house, G o r h a m b u r y , t h e r e were painted glass windows ' a n d every
p a n e with severall figures of beast, bird and flower: perhaps his
L o r d s h i p might u s e t h e m as topiques for locall u s e ' . 7 T h e impor-tance w h i c h Bacon attached to t h e art of m e m o r y is shown b y t h e
fact t h a t it figures quite prominently in t h e Advancement
of
Learning as one of t h e arts a n d sciences which are in need of
reform, b o t h in their m e t h o d s and in t h e ends for which they are

The useful book by Neal W. Gilbert, Renaissance Concepts of Method
(Columbia, 1960) discusses the classical sources of the word and contains
valuable pages on 'art' and 'method'. T h e 'Renaissance concepts of
method' discussed are, however, chiefly Ramist and Aristotelian. The
'methods' with which this next chapter is concerned are not mentioned.
I would think that Ong is probably right (Ramus, Method and the Decay
of Dialogue, Cambridge, Mass., 1958, pp. 231 ff.) in stressing the impor-tance of the revival of Hermogenes in drawing attention to the word
'method'. This revival was fostered by Giulio Camillo (see above, p. 168,

used. T h e extant art of m e m o r y could b e improved, says Bacon,
a n d it should b e used, n o t for empty ostentation, b u t for useful
purposes. T h e general t r e n d of the Advancement towards improv-ing t h e arts a n d sciences a n d turning t h e m to useful ends is
b r o u g h t to bear on m e m o r y , of which, says Bacon, there is an art
extant ' b u t it seemeth to m e that there are better precepts t h a n t h a t
art, a n d better practices of that art t h a n those received'. As n o w
used t h e art m a y b e 'raised to points of ostentation prodigious' b u t
it is barren, a n d n o t used for serious 'business a n d occasions'. H e
defines the art as based o n 'prenotions' and ' e m b l e m s ' , the Bacon-ian version of places a n d images:
This art of memory is but built upon two intentions; the one
prenotion, the other emblem. Prenotion dischargeth the indefinite
seeking of that we would remember, and directeth us to seek in
a narrow compass, that is, somewhat that hath congruity with our
place of memory. Emblem reduceth conceits intellectual to images
sensible, which strike the memory more; out of which axioms may
be drav/n better practique than that in use . . . 8
Places are further defined in t h e Novum

Organum as t h e

order or distribution of Common Places in the artificial memory,
which may be either Places in the proper sense of the word, as a
door, a corner, a window, and the like; or familiar and well known
persons; or anything we choose (provided they are arranged in a
certain order), as animals, herbs; also words, letters, characters,
historical personages . . . 9
Such a definition as this of different types of places comes straight
o u t of t h e m n e m o n i c text-books.
T h e definition of images as ' e m b l e m s ' is expanded in t h e
De augmentis
scientiarum:
Emblems bring down intellectual to sensible things; for what is
sensible always strikes the memory stronger, and sooner impresses
itself than the intellectual . . . And therefore it is easier to retain
the image of a sportsman hunting the hare, of an apothecary ranging
his boxes, an orator making a speech, a boy repeating verses, or a
player acting his part, than the corresponding notions of invention,
disposition, elocution, memory, action. 10

THE ART OF MEMORY AND THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD
W h i c h shows t h a t Bacon fully subscribed to t h e ancient view that
t h e active image impresses itself best on m e m o r y , a n d to t h e
T h o m i s t view t h a t intellectual things are best r e m e m b e r e d
t h r o u g h sensible things. Incidentally, this acceptance of images in
m e m o r y shows t h a t Bacon, t h o u g h influenced b y R a m i s m , was not
a Ramist.
I t was therefore roughly speaking the normal art of m e m o r y
using places a n d images which Bacon accepted a n d practised.
H o w h e proposed to improve it is n o t clear. But amongst t h e new
uses to which it was to b e p u t was t h e memorising of matters in
order so as to hold t h e m in t h e m i n d for investigation. T h i s would
help scientific enquiry, for by drawing particulars out of the mass
of natural history, and ranging t h e m in order, t h e j u d g m e n t could
b e m o r e easily b r o u g h t to bear u p o n t h e m . 1 1 H e r e t h e art of
m e m o r y is being used for t h e investigation of natural science, a n d
its principles of order and arrangement are t u r n i n g into something
like classification.
T h e art of m e m o r y has here indeed been reformed from
'ostentatious' uses by rhetoricians b e n t on impressing b y their
wonderful memories and t u r n e d to serious business. A n d amongst
t h e ostentatious uses which are to b e abolished in t h e reformed use
of the art Bacon certainly has in m i n d t h e occult memories of t h e
Magi. ' T h e ancient opinion t h a t m a n was a microcosmus, an
abstract or m o d e l of t h e world, h a t h b e e n fantastically strained b y
Paracelsus a n d t h e alchemists', h e says in t h e Advancement.12
It
was on t h a t opinion that 'Metrodorian' m e m o r y systems such as
that of F l u d d were based. T o Bacon such schemes m i g h t well have
seemed 'enchanted glasses' full of distorting 'idola', a n d far from
t h a t h u m b l e approach to n a t u r e in observation a n d experiment
which h e advocated.
Nevertheless t h o u g h I would agree with Rossi t h a t t h e Baconian
reform of t h e art of m e m o r y would on t h e whole preclude occult
m e m o r y , yet Bacon is an elusive character a n d there is a passage
in t h e Sylva Sylvarum in w h i c h h e introduces t h e art of m e m o r y
in a context of t h e use of t h e 'force of t h e imagination'. H e tells
a story of a card trick which was worked b y t h e force of t h e imagina-tion of t h e juggler, b y which h e ' b o u n d t h e spirits' of t h e onlooker

THE ART OF MEMORY AND THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD
to ask for a certain card. As a commentary o n this card trick
t h r o u g h 'force of imagination' comes t h e following:
We find in the art of memory, that images visible work better than
other conceits: as if you would remember the word philosophy, you
shall more surely do it by imagining that such a man (for men are
best places) is reading upon Aristotle's Physics; than if you should
imagine him to say, I'll go study philosophy. And therefore this
observation would be translated to the subject we now speak of
(the card trick): for the more lustrous the imagination is, it filleth
and fixeth better. 13
T h o u g h h e is exploring the subject scientifically, Bacon is pro-foundly i m b u e d with t h e classical belief that t h e m n e m o n i c image
has power t h r o u g h stirring t h e imagination, and h e connects this
with 'force of imagination' tricks. T h i s line of t h o u g h t was one
of t h e ways t h r o u g h which the art of m e m o r y became an adjunct of
the magician in t h e Renaissance. Bacon is evidently still seeing
such connections.
Descartes also exercised his great m i n d on t h e art of m e m o r y
and h o w it might be reformed, and the m n e m o n i c author w h o gave
rise to his reflections was n o n e other t h a n L a m b e r t Schenkel. I n
t h e Cogitationes privatae there is t h e following r e m a r k :
On reading through Schenkel's profitable trifles (in the book De
arte memoria) I thought of an easy way of making myself master of
all I discovered through the imagination. This would be done
through the reduction of things to their causes. Since all can be
reduced to one it is obviously not necessary to remember all the
sciences. When one understands the causes all vanished images can
easily be found again in the brain through the impression of the
cause. This is the true art of memory and it is plain contrary to his
(Schenkel's) nebulous notions. Not that his (art) is without effect,
but it occupies the whole space with too many things and not in the
right order. T h e right order is that the images should be formed in
dependence on one another. He (Schenkel) omits this which is the
key to the whole mystery.
I have thought of another way; that out of unconnected images
should be composed new images common to them all, or that one
image should be made which should have reference not only to the
one nearest to it but to them all—so that the fifth should refer to the
13

first through a spear thrown on the ground, the middle one through
a ladder on which they descend, the second one through an arrow
thrown at it, and similarly the third should be connected in some
way either real or fictitious.14
Curiously enough, Descartes's suggested reform of m e m o r y is
nearer to 'occult' principles t h a n Bacon's, for occult m e m o r y does
reduce all things to their supposed causes whose images w h e n
impressed o n m e m o r y are believed to organise t h e subsidiary
images. H a d Descartes consulted P a e p p on 'detecting' Schenkel 1 5
h e would have k n o w n of this. T h e phrase about t h e 'impression of
t h e cause' t h r o u g h which all vanished images can b e found m i g h t
easily b e t h a t of an occult m e m o r y artist. O f course Descartes is
certainly n o t thinking o n such lines b u t his brilliant n e w idea of
organising m e m o r y on causes sounds curiously like a rationalisa-tion of occult m e m o r y . H i s other notions about forming con-nected images are far from n e w a n d can b e found in some form in
nearly every text-book.
I t seems unlikely t h a t Descartes m a d e m u c h use of local m e m o r y
which, according to quotations in Baillet's Life, h e neglected to
practise m u c h in his retreat a n d which h e regarded as 'corporeal
m e m o r y ' a n d 'outside of u s ' as compared with 'intellectual
m e m o r y ' which is within a n d incapable of increase or decrease. 1 6
T h i s singularly c r u d e idea is in keeping with Descarte's lack of
interest in t h e imagination a n d its functioning. Rossi suggests,
however, t h a t t h e m e m o r y principles of order a n d arrangement
influenced Descartes, as they did Bacon.
Both Bacon a n d Descartes knew of t h e art of L u l l to which they
b o t h refer in very derogatory t e r m s . Discussing false m e t h o d s in
t h e Advancement, Bacon says:
There hath been also laboured and put into practice a method,
which is not a lawful method, but a method of imposture; which is,
to deliver knowledges in such a manner, as men may speedily come
to make a show of learning who have it not. Such was the travail of
Raymundus Lullus in making that art which bears his name . . . 1 7

A n d Descartes in t h e Discours de la méthode is equally severe
on t h e Lullian art which serves b u t to enable one 'to

ignorant'. 1 8
T h u s neither t h e discoverer of t h e inductive m e t h o d , which was

t h e m e t h o d of analytical geometry, which was to revolutionise t h e

can there b e between t h e 'emergence of m o d e r n science' a n d that

provide a universal art or m e t h o d which, because based on reality,
could b e applied for t h e solution of all problems. Moreover it was a
kind of geometrical logic, with its squares and triangles and its
revolving combinatory w h e e l s ; and it used a notation of letters to
express t h e concepts with which it was dealing.
W h e n outlining his n e w m e t h o d to Beeckman, in a letter of
M a r c h 1619, Descartes said that what h e was meditating was n o t
an ars brevis of Lull, b u t a n e w science which would b e able to
solve all questions concerning quantity. 1 9 T h e operative w o r d is,
of course, ' q u a n t i t y ' , marking t h e great change from qualitative

a n d t h e Renaissance Lullists, Alsted believed that t h e p s e u d o Lullian De auditu kabbalistico was a genuine Lullian work, 2 1
which facilitated his assimilation of Lullism to Cabalism. Alsted
describes L u l l as a 'mathematician and Cabalist'. 2 2 H e defines
m e t h o d as t h e m n e m o n i c instrument which proceeds from
generals to specials (a definition of course, also influenced b y
Ramism) and h e calls t h e Lullian circles places corresponding
to t h e places of t h e art of m e m o r y . Alsted is a Renaissance
encyclopaedist, a n d a m a n of t h e Renaissance, too, in his efforts
to fuse every kind of m e t h o d in t h e search for a universal
key. 2 3
Yet h e , too, is affected by the reaction against Renaissance
occultism. H e wished to free Lullism from t h e idle dreams a n d

one of Bruno's manuscripts (not, it is t r u e , a Lullian one) after his
death. 2 5 T h e r e seems to b e a m o v e m e n t going on in t h e Alstedian

vast o u t p u t of Alsted.
Another interesting example of the emergence of a m o r e
rational m e t h o d from Renaissance occultism is afforded b y t h e
Orbis pictus of Comenius (first edition in 1658). 2 6 T h i s was a
primer for teaching children languages, such as Latin, G e r m a n ,
Italian, a n d F r e n c h , b y means of pictures. T h e pictures are
arranged in t h e order of t h e world, pictures of t h e heavens, t h e
stars and celestial p h e n o m e n a , of animals, birds, stones and so on,
of m a n and all his activities. Looking at t h e picture of t h e sun, the
child learned t h e word for s u n in all t h e different languages; or
looking at t h e picture of a theatre, 2 7 t h e w o r d for a theatre in all the
languages. T h i s may seem ordinary enough now that t h e market is
saturated with children's picture books, b u t it was an astonishingly
original pedagogic m e t h o d in those times a n d m u s t have m a d e
language-learning enjoyable for m a n y a seventeenth-century child
as compared with t h e dull drudgery accompanied b y frequent
beatings of traditional education. I t is said that t h e boys of Leipzig
in the time of Leibniz were b r o u g h t u p on ' t h e picture book of
C o m e n i u s ' and L u t h e r ' s catechism. 2 8
N o w there can b e n o d o u b t that the Orbis pictus came straight
out of Campanella's City of the Sun,29 that Utopia of astral magic
in which t h e r o u n d central S u n temple, painted with the images of
t h e stars, was s u r r o u n d e d by the concentric circles of t h e walls of
t h e city on w h i c h t h e whole world of t h e creation a n d of m a n and
his activities was represented in images d e p e n d e n t on t h e central
causal images. As has been said earlier, the City of the Sun could b e
used as an occult m e m o r y system t h r o u g h which everything could
b e quickly learned, using t h e world 'as a book' and as 'local
m e m o r y ' . 3 0 T h e children of the S u n City were instructed by t h e
Solarian priests w h o took t h e m r o u n d the City to look at t h e

everything else t h r o u g h t h e images on the walls. T h e pedagogic
m e t h o d of t h e highly occult Solarians, and the whole plan of their
City a n d its images, was a form of local m e m o r y , with its places
and images. T r a n s l a t e d into t h e Orbis pictus, t h e Solarian magic
m e m o r y system becomes a perfectly rational, a n d extremely
original a n d valuable, language primer. I t may b e added t h a t the
U t o p i a n city described b y J o h a n n Valentin Andreae—that
mystery m a n w h o m r u m o u r connected w i t h t h e manifestos of t h e
Rosicrucians—is also decorated all over with pictures which are
used for instructing youth. 3 1 However, Andreae's Christianopolis
was also influenced b y t h e City of the S u n , which was t h u s probably
t h e ultimate source of t h e n e w visual education.
O n e of t h e pre-occupations of t h e seventeenth century was the
search for a universal language. Stimulated by Bacon's d e m a n d for
'real characters' for expressing notions 3 2 —characters or signs
which should b e really in contact with the notions they expressed—
Comenius worked in this direction and t h r o u g h his influence a
whole g r o u p of writers—Bisterfield, Dalgarno, Wilkins and others
—laboured to found universal languages on 'real characters'. As
Rossi has shown, these efforts come straight out of t h e m e m o r y
tradition with its search for signs a n d symbols to use as m e m o r y
images. 3 3 T h e universal languages are t h o u g h t of as aids to
m e m o r y a n d in m a n y cases their authors are obviously drawing on
t h e m e m o r y treatises. A n d it m a y b e added that t h e search for
'real characters' comes o u t of t h e m e m o r y tradition on its occult
side. T h e seventeenth-century universal language enthusiasts are
translating into rational t e r m s efforts such as those of Giordano
Bruno to found universal m e m o r y systems on magic images which
h e t h o u g h t of as directly in contact with reality.
T h u s Renaissance m e t h o d s a n d aims merge into seventeenthcentury m e t h o d s and aims and the seventeenth-century reader did
n o t distinguish t h e m o d e r n aspects of t h e age so sharply as w e d o .

F o r h i m , t h e m e t h o d s of Bacon or of Descartes were just two m o r e
of such things. T h e m o n u m e n t a l Pharus Scientiarum 34 published
in 1659 b y t h e Spanish Jesuit, Sebastian Izquierdo, is an interest-ing example of this.
Izquierdo makes a survey of those w h o have worked towards t h e
founding of a universal art. H e gives considerable space to t h e
'circular m e t h o d ' or Cyclognomica of Cornelius G e m m a (if anyone
ever tries to u n d e r s t a n d t h e Cyclognomic Art which m a y b e
historically important, Izquierdo might h e l p ) ; thence h e passes
to t h e Novum Organum of Francis Bacon, to the art of R a m o n Lull,
a n d t h e art of m e m o r y . Paolo Rossi has written valuable pages on
I z q u i e r d o 3 5 in which h e points o u t t h e importance of t h e Jesuit's
insistence on the need for a universal science to b e applied to all t h e
sciences of the encyclopaedia; for a logic which should include
m e m o r y ; and for an exact procedure in metaphysics to b e modelled
on t h e mathematical sciences. T h e r e m a y b e an influence of
Descartes on t h e last-named project, b u t it is also apparent t h a t
Izquierdo is thinking o n Lullian lines and along the lines of t h e old
efforts to combine LuUism with t h e art of memory. H e insists t h a t
Lullism m u s t b e 'mathematicised' a n d in fact h e gives pages a n d
pages in which, for t h e Lullian combinations of letters, combina-tions of n u m b e r s have been substituted. Rossi suggests t h a t this is
a presage of Leibniz's use of t h e principles of the combinatoria as a
calculus. Athanasius Kircher, a m o r e famous Jesuit, also u r g e d t h e
'mathematicising' of Lullism. 3 6
W h e n one sees in t h e pages of Izquierdo influences from Bacon,
a n d perhaps from Descartes, working side by side with Lullism
and t h e art of m e m o r y , a n d h o w t h e mathematical t r e n d of t h e
century is working amongst t h e older arts, it becomes m o r e a n d
m o r e apparent that t h e emergence of seventeenth-century m e t h o d s
should b e studied in t h e context of the continuing influence of the
arts.
But it is Leibniz w h o affords b y far t h e most remarkable
example of the survival of influences from t h e art of m e m o r y a n d
from Lullism in t h e m i n d of a great seventeenth-century figure. I t

is, of course, generally known that Leibniz was interested in
Lullism a n d w r o t e a work De arte combinatoria based o n adapta-tions of Lullism. 3 7 W h a t is not so well known, t h o u g h it has been
pointed o u t b y Paolo Rossi, is that Leibniz was also very familiar
with t h e traditions of t h e classical art of m e m o r y . I n fact, Leibniz's
efforts at inventing a universal calculus using combinations of sig-nificant signs or characters can undoubtedly b e seen as descending
historically from those Renaissance efforts to combine Lullism
with t h e art of m e m o r y of which Giordano B r u n o was such an
outstanding example. But t h e significant signs or characters of
Leibniz's 'characteristica' were mathematical symbols, a n d their
logical combinations were to produce t h e invention of t h e
infinitesimal calculus.
Amongst Leibniz's unpublished manuscripts at Hanover there
are references to t h e art of m e m o r y , mentioning in particular
L a m b e r t Schenkel on t h e subject (this is t h e m e m o r y writer also
mentioned b y Descartes) a n d another well-known m e m o r y
treatise, t h e Simonides Redivivus of A d a m Bruxius published at
Leipzig in 1610. Following indications given b y Couturat, Paolo
Rossi has d r a w n attention to this evidence from t h e manuscripts
that Leibniz was interested in t h e art of m e m o r y . 3 8 T h e r e is also
plenty of evidence of this i n t h e published works. T h e Nova
methodus discendae docendaeque jurisprudentia (1667) contains long
discussions of m e m o r y a n d t h e art of m e m o r y . 3 9 Mnemonica, says
Leibniz, provides t h e matter of an a r g u m e n t ; Methodologia gives it
f o r m ; a n d Logica is t h e application of t h e m a t t e r to t h e form. H e
then defines Mnemonica as t h e joining of t h e image of some
sensible thing to t h e thing to b e r e m e m b e r e d , a n d this image h e
calls a nota. T h e 'sensible' nota m u s t have some connection with
t h e thing to b e r e m e m b e r e d , either because it is like it, or unlike it,
or connected w i t h it. I n this way words can b e r e m e m b e r e d , t h o u g h
this is very difficult, a n d also things. H e r e t h e m i n d of t h e great

T h i s passage is a litde m e m o r y treatise b y Leibniz. I a m inclined
to think that t h e figure on which a n u m b e r of visual emblems are
disposed on t h e title-page of t h e Disputatio de casibus in jure
(1666) 4 1 is intended to b e used as a local m e m o r y system for
r e m e m b e r i n g law suits (a thoroughly classical use of t h e art of
memory) a n d m a n y other indications of Leibniz's knowledge of t h e
tricks of t h e m e m o r y trade could n o d o u b t b e unearthed. O n e
which I have noticed is t h e remark (in a work of 1678) that t h e Ars
memoriae suggests a way of r e m e m b e r i n g a series of ideas b y
attaching t h e m to a series of personages, such as patriarchs,
apostles, or emperors 4 2 —which takes u s back to one of the most
characteristic a n d time-honoured of t h e m e m o r y practices which
h a d grown u p a r o u n d t h e classical rules.
T h u s Leibniz knew t h e m e m o r y tradition extremely well; h e h a d
studied t h e m e m o r y treatises a n d h a d picked u p , n o t only t h e
m a i n lines of t h e classical rules, b u t also complications which h a d
grown u p a r o u n d these in t h e m e m o r y tradition. A n d h e was
interested in t h e principles on which t h e classical art was based.
O f Leibniz a n d Lullism m u c h has b e e n written, a n d ample
evidence of t h e influence u p o n h i m of t h e Lullist tradition is
afforded b y the Dissertatio de arte combinatoria (1666). T h e opening

omitting 'Jordanus B r u n u s ' . B r u n o , says Leibniz, called t h e
Lullian A r t a 'combinatoria' 4 5 —the word which Leibniz himself is
using of his n e w Lullism. H e (Leibniz) is interpreting Lullism
with arithmetic a n d w i t h t h e 'inventive logic' which Francis Bacon
wanted to improve. T h e r e is already here t h e idea of using t h e
'combinatoria' with mathematics which, as we have seen, h a d been
developing in Alsted, Izquierdo, and Kircher.
I n this n e w mathematical-Lullist art, says Leibniz, notae will b e
used as an alphabet. T h e s e notae are to b e as 'natural' as possible, a
universal writing. T h e y m a y b e like geometrical figures, or like t h e
'pictures' used b y t h e Egyptians a n d t h e Chinese, t h o u g h t h e new
Leibnizian notae will b e better for ' m e m o r y ' t h a n these. 4 6 I n t h e
other context in w h i c h w e have already m e t t h e Leibnizian notae
these were quite definitely connected with t h e m e m o r y tradition,
a n d were something like t h e images d e m a n d e d b y t h e classical art.
A n d h e r e , too, they are connected with m e m o r y . I t is perfectly
clear that Leibniz is emerging out of a Renaissance tradition—out
of those u n e n d i n g efforts to combine Lullism with the classical
art of m e m o r y .
T h e Dissertatio de arte combinatoria is an early work of Leibniz's,
written before his sojourn in Paris (1672–6) during w h i c h h e
perfected his mathematical studies, learning from H u y g h e n s a n d
others of all t h e recent advances in t h e higher mathematics. I t was
from this work t h a t h e was to make his own advances, a n d into t h a t
history belongs t h e emergence of t h e infinitesimal calculus, which
Leibniz arrived at apparently quite independently of Isaac
N e w t o n w h o was working o n similar lines at t h e same time. A b o u t
N e w t o n , I have n o t h i n g to say, b u t t h e context in which t h e infini-tesimal calculus emerges in Leibniz belongs into t h e history traced
in this book. Leibniz himself said t h a t t h e g e r m of his later
thinking was in t h e Dissertatio de arte combinatoria.
As is well k n o w n , Leibniz formed a project k n o w n as t h e
'characteristica'. 4 7 Lists were to b e d r a w n u p of all t h e essential
notions of t h o u g h t , a n d to these notions were t o b e assigned
symbols or 'characters'. T h e influence of t h e age-long search since

Simonides, for 'images for things' on such a scheme is obvious.
Leibniz knew of t h e aspirations so widely current in t h e time for
t h e formation of a universal language of signs or symbols 4 8 (the
schemes of Bisterfield a n d others) b u t such schemes, as has already
been m e n t i o n e d , were themselves influenced by t h e m n e m o n i c
tradition. A n d t h e 'characteristica' of Leibniz was to b e m o r e t h a n
a universal language; it was to b e a 'calculus'. T h e 'characters'
were to b e used in logical combinations to form a universal art or
calculus for t h e solution of all problems. T h e m a t u r e Leibniz, t h e
s u p r e m e mathematician and logician, is obviously still emerging
straight o u t of Renaissance efforts for conflating t h e classical art of
m e m o r y with Lullism b y using the images of t h e classical art on t h e
Lullian combinatory wheels.
Allied to t h e 'characteristica' or calculus in Leibniz's m i n d was
t h e project for an encyclopaedia which was to bring together all t h e
arts a n d sciences k n o w n to m a n . W h e n all knowledge was systematised in t h e encyclopaedia, 'characters' could b e assigned to all
notions, a n d t h e universal calculus would eventually b e established
for t h e solution of all problems. Leibniz envisaged t h e application
of t h e calculus to all departments of t h o u g h t a n d activity. Even
religious difficulties would b e removed b y it. 4 9 T h o s e in disagree-m e n t , for example, about t h e Council of T r e n t would n o longer
go to war b u t would sit d o w n together saying, ' L e t us calculate.'
R a m o n L u l l believed that his Art, with its letter notations a n d
revolving geometrical figures, could b e applied to all t h e subjects of
the encyclopaedia, and t h a t it could convince Jews a n d Moham-m e d a n s of t h e t r u t h s of Christianity. Giulio Camillo h a d formed a
M e m o r y T h e a t r e in which all knowledge was to b e synthetised
t h r o u g h images. Giordano B r u n o , p u t t i n g t h e images in m o v e m e n t
o n t h e Lullian combinatory wheels, h a d travelled all over E u r o p e
with his fantastic arts of m e m o r y . Leibniz is t h e seventeenthcentury heir to this tradition.
Leibniz tried to interest various potentates and academies in his
projects b u t without success. T h e encyclopaedia was never d r a w n
u p ; t h e assignment of t h e 'characters' to t h e notions was never
completed; t h e universal calculus was never established. W e are

mathematics were fundamentally due to his having succeeded in
finding symbols for representing quantities and their relations.
' A n d indeed', says Couturat, 'there is no d o u b t t h a t his most
famous invention, that of the infinitesimal calculus, arose from his
constant search for new and m o r e general symbolisms, and that,
inversely, this invention confirmed h i m in his opinion of t h e capital
importance for t h e deductive sciences of a good characteristic.' 5 0
Leibniz's profound originality, continues Couturat, consisted in
representing b y appropriate signs, notions a n d operations for
which no notation had hitherto existed. 5 1 I n short, it was t h r o u g h
his invention of new 'characters' t h a t h e was able to operate the
infinitesimal calculus, which was b u t a fragment, or a specimen, of
t h e never completed 'universal characteristic'.
If, as has been suggested, Leibniz's 'characteristica' as a whole
comes straight out of t h e m e m o r y tradition, it would follow t h a t t h e
search for 'images for things', w h e n transferred to mathematical
symbolism, resulted in t h e discovery of n e w a n d better mathe-matical or logico-mathematical, notations, making possible new
types of calculation.
I t was always a principle with Leibniz in his search for 'charac-ters' that these should represent as nearly as possible reality, or the
real n a t u r e of things, and there are several passages in his works
which t h r o w an illuminating light o n t h e background of his
search. F o r example, in t h e Fundamenta calculi ratiocinatoris, h e
defines 'characters' as signs which are either written, or delineated,
or sculptured. A sign is the m o r e useful t h e closer it is to the thing
signified. But Leibniz says that t h e characters of the chemist or of
the astronomers, such as J o h n D e e p u t forward in his Monas

hieroglyphica, are n o t of use, nor t h e figures of t h e Chinese a n d t h e
Egyptians. T h e language of A d a m , by which h e n a m e d t h e crea-t u r e s , m u s t have b e e n close to reality, b u t w e do n o t know it. T h e
words of ordinary languages are imprecise and their use leads to
error. W h a t alone are best for accurate enquiry and calculation are
t h e notae of t h e arithmeticians and algebraists. 5 2
T h e passage, and there are others similar to it, shows Leibniz
conducting his search, moving meditatively in t h e world of t h e
past amongst t h e magic 'characters', t h e signs of t h e alchemists, t h e
images of t h e astrologers, of D e e ' s monas formed of t h e characters
of t h e seven planets, of t h e r u m o u r e d A d a m i c language, magically
in contact with reality, of the Egyptian hieroglyphs in which t r u t h
was h i d d e n . O u t of all this h e emerges, like his century emerging
from t h e occultism of t h e Renaissance, finding t h e t r u e notae, t h e
characters nearest to reality in t h e symbols of mathematics.
Yet Leibniz knew that past very well, a n d was perhaps even
g u a r d i n g against suspicions that his 'universal characteristic' m i g h t
b e too closely connected with it w h e n h e speaks of his project as
an 'innocent magia' or a ' t r u e Cabala'. 5 3 A t other times h e will
present it very m u c h in t h e language of t h e past, as a great secret, a
universal key. T h e introduction to t h e 'arcana' of his encyclopaedia
states t h a t here will b e found a general science, a n e w logic, a n e w
m e t h o d , a n Ars reminiscendi or M n e m o n i c a , a n Ars
Characteristica or Symbolica, an Ars Combinatoria or Lulliana, a Cabala of
t h e Wise, a Magia Naturalis, in short all sciences will h e r e b e

ineptitudes of magic with which books are full. 5 6 T h e light of
t r u t h has b e e n lacking which only mathematical discipline can

L e t us t u r n back n o w a n d gaze once m o r e at t h a t strange diagram
(P1. 11) which w e excavated from Bruno's Shadows, w h e r e t h e
magic images of t h e stars revolving on t h e central wheel control t h e

t h e images o n t h e outer wheel representing all t h e activities of

m e t h o d k n o w n t o t h e ex-Dominican m e m o r y expert is tirelessly
tried in combinations t h e efficacy of which rests on t h e m e m o r y
image conceived of as containing magical force. L e t us read again
t h e passage at t h e e n d of Seals (which can b e paralleled from all
B r u n o ' s other m e m o r y books) in which t h e occult m e m o r y artist
lists t h e kinds of images w h i c h m a y b e used o n t h e Lullian com-binatory wheels, amongst w h i c h figure prominently signs, notae,
characters, seals. 5 8 O r let u s contemplate t h e spectacle of t h e

b o t h as magic images of reality a n d as m e m o r y images compre-h e n d i n g all possible notions, o n t h e wheel in Statues. O r think
of t h e inextricable m a z e of m e m o r y rooms in Images, full of images
of all things in t h e elemental world, controlled b y t h e significant

was a fierce scientific impulse in those efforts, a striving, o n t h e
H e r m e t i c plane, after some m e t h o d of t h e future, half-glimpsed,
half-dreamed of, prophetically foreshadowed in those infinitely
intricate gropings after a calculus of m e m o r y images, after
arrangements of m e m o r y orders in which t h e Lullian principle of
m o v e m e n t should somehow b e combined with a magicised
mnemonics using characters of reality.

THE ART OF MEMORY AND THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD
looking back n o w from t h e vantage point of Leibniz we m a y see
Giordano B r u n o as a Renaissance p r o p h e t , o n t h e H e r m e t i c plane,
of scientific m e t h o d , a n d a p r o p h e t w h o shows us t h e importance
of t h e classical art of m e m o r y , combined with Lullism, in pre-paring t h e way for t h e finding of a Great Key.
But t h e matter does not e n d here. W e have always h i n t e d or
guessed that there was a secret side to Bruno's m e m o r y systems,
t h a t they were a m o d e of transmitting a religion, or an ethic, or
some message of universal import. A n d there was a message of
universal love and brotherhood, of religious toleration, of charity
and benevolence implied in Liebniz's projects for his universal
calculus or characteristic. Plans for t h e reunion of t h e churches,
for t h e pacification of sectarian differences, for t h e foundation of an
' O r d e r of Charity', form a basic p a r t of his schemes. T h e progress
of t h e sciences, Leibniz believed, would lead to an extended
knowledge of t h e universe, a n d therefore to a wider knowledge of
G o d , its creator, a n d thence to a wider extension of charity, t h e
source of all virtues. 5 9 Mysticism a n d philanthropy are b o u n d u p
with t h e encyclopaedia and t h e universal calculus. W h e n we think
of this side of Leibniz, t h e comparison with B r u n o is again striking.
T h e religion of L o v e , Art, Magic, and Mathesis was h i d d e n in t h e
Seals of M e m o r y . A religion of love and general philanthropy is to
b e m a d e manifest, or b r o u g h t about, t h r o u g h t h e universal
calculus. I f we delete M a g i c , substitute genuine mathematics for
Mathesis, u n d e r s t a n d A r t as t h e calculus, a n d retain L o v e , t h e
Leibnizian aspirations seem to approximate strikingly closely—
t h o u g h in a seventeenth-century transformation—to those of
Bruno.
A 'Rosicrucian' aura clings to Leibniz, a suggestion often
vaguely raised, a n d dismissed w i t h o u t examination or discussion
of t h e m a n y passages in Leibniz's works in which h e mentions
'Christian Rosenkreuz', or Valentin A n d r e a e , or refers, directly or
indirectly, to t h e Rosicrucian manifestos. 6 0 I t is impossible to

Couturat, Logique de Leibniz, pp. 131–2, 135–8, etc.
That Leibniz was a Rosicrucian is, however, firmly acepted by that
excellent scholar, Couturat: 'On sait que Leibniz s'etait affilié en 1666
à Nürnberg à la société secrète des Rose-Croix' (Logique de Leibniz, p. 131,
note 3). Leibniz himself may hint that he. was a Rosicrucian (Philosophische Schriften, ed. Ritter, Vol. I (1930), p. 276). The rules for his

investigate this p r o b l e m h e r e , b u t it is a possible hypothesis t h a t
t h e curious connections between B r u n o a n d Leibniz—which
u n d o u b t e d l y exist—might b e accounted for t h r o u g h t h e m e d i u m
of a H e r m e t i c society, founded b y Bruno in G e r m a n y , a n d after-wards developing as Rosicrucianism. T h e ' T h i r t y Seals' which
Bruno p u b l i s h e d in G e r m a n y . 6 1 a n d their connections with t h e
L a t i n poems published in G e r m a n y , would b e t h e starting-point
for such a n investigation at t h e Bruno end. A n d t h e enquiry from
t h e Leibniz e n d would have to await t h e full publication of
Leibniz manuscripts a n d t h e clearing u p of t h e present unsatis-factory situation concerning t h e edition of t h e works. W e shall
therefore n o d o u b t have to wait a long time for t h e solution of this
problem.
T h e standard histories of m o d e r n philosophy, which repeat
after o n e another t h e idea t h a t t h e t e r m ' m o n a d ' was borrowed b y
Leibniz from B r u n o , omit as quite outside their purview any
mention of t h e H e r m e t i c tradition from which Bruno a n d other
H e r m e t i c philosophers of t h e Renaissance took t h e word. T h o u g h
Leibniz as a philosopher of t h e seventeenth century has moved into
another atmosphere a n d a n e w world, t h e Leibnizian monadology
bears u p o n it t h e obvious marks of t h e H e r m e t i c tradition. T h e
Leibnizian m o n a d s , w h e n they are h u m a n souls having m e m o r y ,
have as their chief function t h e representation or reflection of t h e
universe of which they are living m i r r o r s 6 2 — a conception with
which t h e reader of this book will b e thoroughly familiar.
A detailed comparison of B r u n o with Leibniz, o n entirely n e w
lines, m i g h t b e one of t h e best approaches to t h e study of t h e
emergence of t h e seventeenth century o u t of t h e Renaissance
H e r m e t i c tradition. A n d such a s t u d y m i g h t demonstrate t h a t all
t h a t was m o s t noble in t h e religious a n d philanthropic aspirations
of seventeenth-century science was already present, o n t h e Her-metic plane, in Giordano B r u n o , transmitted b y h i m in t h e secret

THE ART OF MEMORY AND THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD
I have chosen to e n d m y history with Leibniz, because one m u s t
stop somewhere, a n d because it m a y b e t h a t here ends the influence
of t h e art of m e m o r y as a factor in basic E u r o p e a n developments.
But t h e r e w e r e m a n y survivals in later centuries. Books o n t h e art
of m e m o r y continued to appear, still recognisably in t h e classical
tradition, a n d it is unlikely t h a t t h e traditions of occult m e m o r y
were lost, or ceased to influence significant movements. Another
book could probably b e written carrying t h e subject o n into later
centuries.
T h o u g h this book has tried to give some account of t h e history of
the art of m e m o r y in t h e periods covered, it should not b e regarded
as in any sense a complete or final history. I have used only a
fraction of t h e material available, or which m i g h t b e m a d e available
b y further research, for t h e study of this vast subject. T h e serious
investigation of this forgotten art m a y b e said to have only just
begun. S u c h subjects do n o t have b e h i n d t h e m , as yet, an apparatus
of organised m o d e r n scholarship; t h e y do n o t belong into t h e
n o r m a l curricula a n d so they are left out. T h e art of m e m o r y is a
clear case of a marginal subject, n o t recognised as belonging to any
of t h e n o r m a l disciplines, having been omitted because it was n o
one's business. A n d yet it has t u r n e d out to b e , in a sense, every-one's business. T h e history of t h e organisation of m e m o r y
touches at vital points on t h e history of religion a n d ethics, of
philosophy a n d psychology, of art a n d literature, of scientific
m e t h o d . T h e artificial m e m o r y as a part of rhetoric belongs into
t h e rhetoric t r a d i t i o n ; m e m o r y as a power of the soul belongs w i t h
theology. W h e n w e reflect o n these profound afiiliations of o u r
t h e m e it begins to seem after all n o t so surprising that t h e p u r s u i t
of it should have opened u p n e w views of some of t h e greatest
manifestations of our culture.
I a m conscious as I look back of h o w little I have understood of
t h e significance for whole tracts of history of t h e art w h i c h
Simonides was supposed to have invented after t h a t legendary
disastrous b a n q u e t .
